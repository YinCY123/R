@article{Reshef2011a,
abstract = {Identifying interesting relationships between pairs of variables in large data sets is increasingly important. Here, we present a measure of dependence for two-variable relationships: the maximal information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide range of associations both functional and not, and for functional relationships provides a score that roughly equals the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) of the data relative to the regression function. MIC belongs to a larger class of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics for identifying and classifying relationships. We apply MIC and MINE to data sets in global health, gene expression, major-league baseball, and the human gut microbiota and identify known and novel relationships.},

@article{Strang2005a,
abstract = {Renowned professor and author Gilbert Strang demonstrates that linear algebra is a fascinating subject by showing both its beauty and value. While the mathematics is there, the effort is not all concentrated on proofs. Strang's emphasis is on understanding. He explains concepts, rather than deduces. This book is written in an informal and personal style and teaches real mathematics. The gears change in Chapter 2 as students reach the introduction of vector spaces. Throughout the book, the theory is motivated and reinforced by genuine applications, allowing pure mathematicians to teach applied mathematics.},

The outstanding problem sets are a hallmark feature of this book. Provides clear, complete explanations to fully explain mathematical concepts. Features subsections on the probabilistic method and the maximum-minimums identity. Includes many new examples relating to DNA matching, utility, finance, and applications of the probabilistic method. Features an intuitive treatment of probabilityintuitive explanations follow many examples. The Probability Models Disk included with each copy of the book, contains six probability models that are referenced in the book and allow readers to quickly and easily perform calculations and simulations.},
