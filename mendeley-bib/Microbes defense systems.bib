abstract = {The spontaneous deamination of cytosine is a major source of C•G to T•A transitions, which account for half of known human pathogenic point mutations. The ability to efficiently convert target A•T base pairs to G•C could therefore advance the study and treatment of genetic diseases. While the deamination of adenine yields inosine, which is treated as guanine by polymerases, no enzymes are known to deaminate adenine in DNA. Here we report adenine base editors (ABEs) that mediate conversion of A•T to G•C in genomic DNA. We evolved a tRNA adenosine deaminase to operate on DNA when fused to a catalytically impaired CRISPR-Cas9. Extensive directed evolution and protein engineering resulted in seventh- generation ABEs ( e.g. , ABE7.10), that convert target A•T to G•C base pairs efficiently ( {\~{}} 50{\%} in human cells) with very high product purity (typically ≥ 99.9{\%}) and very low rates of indels (typically ≤ 0.1{\%}). ABEs introduce point mutations more efficiently and cleanly than a current Cas9 nuclease-based method, induce less off-target genome modification than Cas9, and can install disease-correcting or disease-suppressing mutations in human cells. Together with our previous base editors, ABEs advance genome editing by enabling the direct, programmable introduction of all four transition mutations without double-stranded DNA cleavage.},

abstract = {RNA interference is widely distributed in eukaryotes and has a variety of functions, including antiviral defence and gene regulation. All RNA interference pathways use small single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) molecules that guide proteins of the Argonaute (Ago) family to complementary ssRNA targets: RNA-guided RNA interference. The role of prokaryotic Ago variants has remained elusive, although bioinformatics analysis has suggested their involvement in host defence. Here we demonstrate that Ago of the bacterium Thermus thermophilus (TtAgo) acts as a barrier for the uptake and propagation of foreign DNA. In vivo, TtAgo is loaded with 5'-phosphorylated DNA guides, 13-25 nucleotides in length, that are mostly plasmid derived and have a strong bias for a 5'-end deoxycytidine. These small interfering DNAs guide TtAgo to cleave complementary DNA strands. Hence, despite structural homology to its eukaryotic counterparts, TtAgo functions in host defence by DNA-guided DNA interference.},

Recently, however, the structure of human Argonaute-2 (hAgo2), a model for RISC function, was determined in complexes with heterogeneous guide RNA and in complexes with a specific miRNA.

@article{Kleinstiver2015,
abstract = {Although CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases are widely used for genome editing, the range of sequences that Cas9 can recognize is constrained by the need for a specific protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). As a result, it can often be difficult to target double-stranded breaks (DSBs) with the precision that is necessary for various genome-editing applications. The ability to engineer Cas9 derivatives with purposefully altered PAM specificities would address this limitation. Here we show that the commonly used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) can be modified to recognize alternative PAM sequences using structural information, bacterial selection-based directed evolution, and combinatorial design. These altered PAM specificity variants enable robust editing of endogenous gene sites in zebrafish and human cells not currently targetable by wild-type SpCas9, and their genome-wide specificities are comparable to wild-type SpCas9 as judged by GUIDE-seq analysis. In addition, we identify and characterize another SpCas9 variant that exhibits improved specificity in human cells, possessing better discrimination against off-target sites with non-canonical NAG and NGA PAMs and/or mismatched spacers. We also find that two smaller-size Cas9 orthologues, Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9 (St1Cas9) and Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9), function efficiently in the bacterial selection systems and in human cells, suggesting that our engineering strategies could be extended to Cas9s from other species. Our findings provide broadly useful SpCas9 variants and, more importantly, establish the feasibility of engineering a wide range of Cas9s with altered and improved PAM specificities.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic Argonautes bind small RNAs and use them as guides to find complementary RNA targets and induce gene silencing. Though homologs of eukaryotic Argonautes are present in many bacteria and archaea, their small RNA partners and functions are unknown. We found that the Argonaute of Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RsAgo) associates with 15-19 nt RNAs that correspond to the majority of transcripts. RsAgo also binds single-stranded 22-24 nt DNA molecules that are complementary to the small RNAs and enriched in sequences derived from exogenous plasmids as well as genome-encodedforeign nucleic acids such as transposons and phage genes. Expression of RsAgo in the heterologous E.coli system leads to formation of plasmid-derived small RNA and DNA and plasmid degradation. In a R.sphaeroides mutant lacking RsAgo, expression of plasmid-encoded genes is elevated. Our results indicate that RNAi-related processes found in eukaryotes are also conserved in bacteria and target foreign nucleic acids. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The constant exposure to phage infection imposes a strong selective pressure on bacteria to develop viral resistance strategies that promote prokaryotic survival. Thus, this parasite-host relationship results in an evolutionary arms race of adaptation and counteradaptation between the interacting partners. The evolutionary outcome is a spectrum of remarkable strategies used by the bacteria and phages as they attempt to coexist. These approaches include adsorption inhibition, injection blocking, abortive infection, toxin-antitoxin, and CRISPR-Cas systems. In this review, we highlight the diverse and complementary antiphage systems in bacteria, as well as the evasion mechanisms used by phages to escape these resistance strategies.},

Cas9-guide RNA complexes are also effective genome engineering agents in animals and plants. Here we use single-molecule and bulk biochemical experiments to determine how Cas9-RNA interrogates DNA to find specific cleavage sites. We show that both binding and cleavage of DNA by Cas9-RNA require recognition of a short trinucleotide protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Non-target DNA binding affinity scales with PAM density, and sequences fully complementary to the guide RNA but lacking a nearby PAM are ignored by Cas9-RNA. Competition assays provide evidence that DNA strand separation and RNA-DNA heteroduplex formation initiate at the PAM and proceed directionally towards the distal end of the target sequence. Furthermore, PAM interactions trigger Cas9 catalytic activity. These results reveal how Cas9 uses PAM recognition to quickly identify potential target sites while scanning large DNA molecules, and to regulate scission of double-stranded DNA.},

abstract = {Prokaryotic Argonaute proteins acquire guide strands derived from invading or mobile genetic elements, via an unknown pathway, to direct guide-dependent cleavage of foreign DNA. Here, we report that Argonaute from the archaeal organism Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjAgo) possesses two modes of action: the canonical guide-dependent endonuclease activity and a non-guided DNA endonuclease activity. The latter allows MjAgo to process long double-stranded DNAs, including circular plasmid DNAs and genomic DNAs. Degradation of substrates in a guide-independent fashion primes MjAgo for subsequent rounds of DNA cleavage. Chromatinized genomic DNA is resistant to MjAgo degradation, and recombinant histones protect DNA from cleavage in vitro. Mutational analysis shows that key residues important for guide-dependent target processing are also involved in guide-independent MjAgo function. This is the first characterization of guide-independent cleavage activity for an Argonaute protein potentially serving as a guide biogenesis pathway in a prokaryotic system. A rgonaute (Ago) proteins are crucially involved in RNA-guided or DNA-guided degradation of target nucleic acids 1–3 . Present in all three domains of life, they bind guide strands in vivo to target complementary nucleic acids. Eukaryotic Agos interact with cytoplasmic RNA substrates 18–23 bp in length 4–6 , while prokaryotic Agos (pAgos) bind and process a variety of DNA and RNA substrates 7–11 . Among them, Agos from the archaeal organisms Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjAgo), Pyrococcus furiosus (PfAgo) and Natronobacterium gregoryi (NgAgo) are the only Ago variants that exclusively cleave DNA sub-strates using a DNA guide in vitro 7,11–13 . Guide recognition is mediated by a phosphate group at the 5′ end of the guide, which is coordinated in the Mid domain by conserved amino-acid side-chain interactions 14–18 . One exception comprises the recently characterized bacterial Agos from Marinitoga piezophila (MpAgo) and Thermotoga profunda (TpAgo), which recognize RNA guides with a 5′-hydroxyl group 19 . Loaded with the guide, Ago binds par-tially or fully complementary target nucleic acids via Watson–Crick base pairing. Only fully complementary target strands are cleaved by Ago. The catalytic site resides in the PIWI domain. Notably, numer-ous pAgos, especially short Ago variants, have an incomplete cata-lytic site, rendering them inactive 2},

Existing strategies for reducing genome-wide off-target effects of the widely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) are imperfect, possessing only partial or unproven efficacies and other limitations that constrain their use. Here we describe SpCas9-HF1, a high-fidelity variant harbouring alterations designed to reduce non-specific DNA contacts. SpCas9-HF1 retains on-target activities comparable to wild-type SpCas9 with {\textgreater}85{\%} of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) tested in human cells.

Even for atypical, repetitive target sites, the vast majority of off-target mutations induced by wild-type SpCas9 were not detected with SpCas9-HF1. With its exceptional precision, SpCas9-HF1 provides an alternative to wild-type SpCas9 for research and therapeutic applications.

abstract = {Functions of prokaryotic Argonautes (pAgo) have long remained elusive. Recently, Argonautes of the bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Thermus thermophilus were demonstrated to be involved in host defense. The Argonaute of the archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (PfAgo) belongs to a different branch in the phylogenetic tree, which is most closely related to that of RNA interference-mediating eukaryotic Argonautes. Here we describe a functional and mechanistic characterization of PfAgo. Like the bacterial counterparts, archaeal PfAgo contributes to host defense by interfering with the uptake of plasmid DNA. PfAgo utilizes small 5'-phosphorylated DNA guides to cleave both single stranded and double stranded DNA targets, and does not utilize RNA as guide or target. Thus, with respect to function and specificity, the archaeal PfAgo resembles bacterial Argonautes much more than eukaryotic Argonautes. These findings demonstrate that the role of Argonautes is conserved through the bacterial and archaeal domains of life and suggests that eukaryotic Argonautes are derived from DNA-guided DNA-interfering host defense systems.},

abstract = {Argonaute can be found in all three domains of life and is the functional core of the eukaryotic RNA-silencing machinery. In order to shed light on the conformational changes that drive Argonaute action, we performed single-molecule FRET measurements employing a so far uncharacterized member of the Argonaute family, namely Argonaute from the archaeal organism Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjAgo). We show that MjAgo is a catalytically active Argonaute variant hydrolyzing exclusively DNA target strands out of a DNA/DNA hybrid. We studied the interplay between Argonaute and nucleic acids using fluorescent dyes covalently attached at different positions of the DNA guide as steric reporters. This allowed us to determine structurally confined parts of the protein scaffold and flexible regions of the DNA guide. Single-molecule FRET measurements demonstrate that the 3'end of the DNA guide is released from the PAZ domain upon target strand loading. This conformational change does not necessitate target strand cleavage but a fully complementary target strand. Thus, our data support the two state model for Argonaute action.},

In order to survive the constant onslaught of phage, bacteria have evolved mechanistically diverse defense strategies that act at every stage of the phage life cycle (Fig 1)[4,5]. Phages rapidly co-evolve to overcome these barriers, resulting in a constant, and often surprising, molecular arms race [6].

Here we describe a robust assay in Escherichia coli to explore the hitherto least-studied process, adaptation. We identify essential genes and DNA elements in the leader sequence and in the array which are essential for the adaptation step. We also provide mechanistic insights on the insertion of the repeat-spacer unit by showing that the first repeat serves as the template for the newly inserted repeat.

RISC contains two signature components, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and Argonaute family proteins. Here, we show that the multiple Argonaute proteins present in mammals are both biologically and biochemically distinct, with a single mammalian family member, Argonaute2, being responsible for messenger RNA cleavage activity. This protein is essential for mouse development, and cells lacking Argonaute2 are unable to mount an experimental response to siRNAs. Mutations within a cryptic ribonuclease H domain within Argonaute2, as identified by comparison with the structure of an archeal Argonaute protein, inactivate RISC. Thus, our evidence supports a model in which Argonaute contributes "Slicer" activity to RISC, providing the catalytic engine for RNAi.},

Studies of these viruses proved to be instrumental for the expansion of knowledge on viral diversity and evolution. The Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus 2 (SIRV2) is a model to study virus-host interactions in Archaea. It is a lytic virus that exploits a unique egress mechanism based on the formation of remarkable pyramidal structures on the host cell envelope. Using whole-transcriptome sequencing, we present here a global map defining host and viral gene expression during the infection cycle of SIRV2 in its hyperthermophilic host S. islandicus LAL14/1. This information was used, in combination with a yeast two-hybrid analysis of SIRV2 protein interactions, to advance current understanding of viral gene functions. As a consequence of SIRV2 infection, transcription of more than one-third of S. islandicus genes was differentially regulated. While expression of genes involved in cell division decreased, those genes playing a role in antiviral defense were activated on a large scale. Expression of genes belonging to toxin-antitoxin and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas systems was specifically pronounced. The observed different degree of activation of various CRISPR-Cas systems highlights the specialized functions they perform. The information on individual gene expression and activation of antiviral defense systems is expected to aid future studies aimed at detailed understanding of the functions and interplay of these systems in vivo.},

abstract = {CRISPR-Cas (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats coupled with CRISPR-associated proteins) is a bacterial immunity system that protects against invading phages or plasmids. In the process of CRISPR adaptation, short pieces of DNA ('spacers') are acquired from foreign elements and integrated into the CRISPR array. So far, it has remained a mystery how spacers are preferentially acquired from the foreign DNA while the self chromosome is avoided. Here we show that spacer acquisition is replication-dependent, and that DNA breaks formed at stalled replication forks promote spacer acquisition. Chromosomal hotspots of spacer acquisition were confined by Chi sites, which are sequence octamers highly enriched on the bacterial chromosome, suggesting that these sites limit spacer acquisition from self DNA. We further show that the avoidance of self is mediated by the RecBCD double-stranded DNA break repair complex. Our results suggest that, in Escherichia coli, acquisition of new spacers largely depends on RecBCD-mediated processing of double-stranded DNA breaks occurring primarily at replication forks, and that the preference for foreign DNA is achieved through the higher density of Chi sites on the self chromosome, in combination with the higher number of forks on the foreign DNA. This model explains the strong preference to acquire spacers both from high copy plasmids and from phages.},

This expansion is both quantitative, including the discovery of diverse new examples of known types of defense systems, such as restriction-modification or toxin-antitoxin systems, and qualitative, including the discovery of fundamentally new defense mechanisms, such as the CRISPR-Cas immunity system. Large-scale statistical analysis reveals that the distribution of different defense systems in bacterial and archaeal taxa is non-uniform, with four groups of organisms distinguishable with respect to the overall abundance and the balance between specific types of defense systems. The genes encoding defense system components in bacterial and archaea typically cluster in defense islands. In addition to genes encoding known defense systems, these islands contain numerous uncharacterized genes, which are candidates for new types of defense systems. The tight association of the genes encoding immunity systems and dormancy- or cell death-inducing defense systems in prokaryotic genomes suggests that these two major types of defense are functionally coupled, providing for effective protection at the population level.},

abstract = {The RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 is the most commonly used genome editing tool and employs RNA–DNA hybridization to spe-cifically cleave genomic sequences 1–5 . Although many modifications have been introduced to the Cas9 system to improve its efficiency and specificity, its practical utility is still limited by its tolerance to guide–target mismatches and the relatively easy formation of second-ary structure by its RNA guides 6 . Argonautes are a family of endonucleases that use 5′ phospho-rylated short single-stranded nucleic acids as guides to cleave tar-gets 7 . Similar to Cas9, Argonautes have key roles in gene expression repression and defense against foreign nucleic acids 7–12 . However, Argonautes differ from Cas9 in many ways 7 . Cas9 only exist in prokaryotes, whereas Argonautes are preserved through evolution and exist in virtually all organisms; although most Argonautes asso-ciate with single-stranded (ss)RNAs and have a central role in RNA silencing, some Argonautes bind ssDNAs and cleave target DNAs 11,13 ; guide RNAs must have a 3′ RNA-RNA hybridization structure for cor-rect Cas9 binding, whereas no specific consensus secondary structure of guides is required for Argonaute binding; whereas Cas9 can only cleave a target upstream of a PAM, there is no specific sequence on targets required for Argonaute. Once Argonaute and guides bind, they affect the physicochemical characteristics of each other and work as a whole with kinetic properties more typical of nucleic-acid-binding proteins 14 . Probably owing to these characteristics, Argonautes have evolved into a large family of proteins that fulfill many different tasks. Here we show that the Argonaute of N. gregoryi can be programmed with ssDNA guides, and is a precise and efficient tool for genome editing in mammalian cells. RESULTS Argonaute derived from N. gregoryi uses DNA guides and cleaves DNA Argonaute from Thermus thermophilus (TtAgo) or Pyrococcus furio-sus (PfAgo) catalyzes cleavage of DNA targets in vitro when supplied with complementary 5′ phosphorylated ssDNA 11,13 . However, both of them require a reaction temperature {\textgreater}65 °C, precluding them from acting in mammalian cells. To find an Argonaute suitable for editing mammalian genome, we performed a search using Position-Specific Iterative Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (PSI-BLAST) against the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein sequence database using the amino acid sequences of TtAgo and PfAgo and identified an Argonaute derived from haloal-kaliphilic archaebacterium N. gregoryi SP2 (NgAgo, protein identifier AFZ73749.1) as a potential candidate. To confirm that NgAgo uses ssDNA guides, we analyzed the nucleic acids purified from NgAgo expressed in Escherichia coli, as those bac-teria produce both 5′-phosphorylated ssRNAs and ssDNAs, and the nucleic acids of proper length (13–25 nt) naturally bind to prokaryo-tic Argonautes 11,12 . Nuclease digestion confirmed that DNA but not RNA binds NgAgo (Fig. 1a). To test whether the NgAgo expressed by E. coli can cleave target DNA at 37 °C in vitro, we performed an in vitro plasmid cleavage assay. We designed three 5′ phosphorylated 24-nucleotide (nt) ssDNA guides, among which two guides were complementary to each other ('FW' and 'RV' guides) and corre-sponded to a target site in plasmid pACYCDuet-eGFP, which had no homologous sequence to the NgAgo-encoding plasmid pGEX6P-1 (Fig. 1b). The other guide had a random sequence without overlap with pACYCDuet-eGFP (noncomplementary ('NC') guide). We also designed a pair of 5′-phosphorylated RNA guides corresponding to the same target site. Before the cleavage assay, we replaced the native nucleic acids bound to the purified) NgAgo with our designed guides by incubating NgAgo with the guides at 55 °C for 1 h. NgAgo could not catalyze cleavage without guide or with the NC guide (Fig. 1b). When supplied with either of the complementary FW or RV guides, NgAgo could nick the negatively supercoiled plas-mid at 37 °C; when supplied with both FW and RV guides, NgAgo linearized the plasmid. However, neither ssDNA guides without 5′ phosphorylation nor 5′-phosphorylated ssRNA guides led to plasmid DNA-guided genome editing using the Natronobacterium gregoryi Argonaute},

abstract = {RNAi has existed at least since the divergence of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This collection of pathways responds to a diversity of "abberant" RNAs and generally silences or eliminates genes sharing sequence content with the silencing trigger. In the canonical pathway, double-stranded RNAs are processed into small RNAs, which guide effector complexes to their targets by complementary base pairing. Many alternative routes from silencing trigger to small RNA are continuously being uncovered. Though the triggers of the pathway and the mechanisms of small RNA production are many, all RNAi-related mechanisms share Argonaute proteins as the heart of their effector complexes. These can act as self-contained silencing machines, binding directly to small RNAs, carrying out homology-based target recognition, and in some cases cleaving targets using an endogenous nuclease domain. Here, we discuss the diversity of Argonaute proteins from a structural and functional perspective.},

abstract = {Argonaute proteins (Agos) are present in all domains of life. Although the physiological function of eukaryotic Agos in regulating gene expression is well documented, the biological roles of many of their prokaryotic counterparts remain enigmatic. In some bacteria, Agos are associated with CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) loci and use noncanonical 5'-hydroxylated guide RNAs (gRNAs) for nucleic acid targeting. Here we show that using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) as the 5' nucleotide of gRNAs stabilizes in vitro reconstituted CRISPR-associatedMarinitoga piezophilaArgonaute-gRNA complexes (MpAgo RNPs) and significantly improves their specificity and affinity for RNA targets. Using reconstituted MpAgo RNPs with 5'-BrdU-modified gRNAs, we mapped the seed region of the gRNA and identified the nucleotides of the gRNA that play the most significant role in targeting specificity. We also show that these MpAgo RNPs can be programmed to distinguish between substrates that differ by a single nucleotide, using permutations at the sixth and seventh positions in the gRNA. Using these specificity features, we employed MpAgo RNPs to detect specific adenosine-to-inosine-edited RNAs in a complex mixture. These findings broaden our mechanistic understanding of the interactions of Argonautes with guide and substrate RNAs, and demonstrate that MpAgo RNPs with 5'-BrdU-modified gRNAs can be used as a highly specific RNA-targeting platform to probe RNA biology.},

@article{Makarova2009a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In eukaryotes, RNA interference (RNAi) is a major mechanism of defense against viruses and transposable elements as well of regulating translation of endogenous mRNAs. The RNAi systems recognize the target RNA molecules via small guide RNAs that are completely or partially complementary to a region of the target. Key components of the RNAi systems are proteins of the Argonaute-PIWI family some of which function as slicers, the nucleases that cleave the target RNA that is base-paired to a guide RNA. Numerous prokaryotes possess the CRISPR-associated system (CASS) of defense against phages and plasmids that is, in part, mechanistically analogous but not homologous to eukaryotic RNAi systems. Many prokaryotes also encode homologs of Argonaute-PIWI proteins but their functions remain unknown. RESULTS: We present a detailed analysis of Argonaute-PIWI protein sequences and the genomic neighborhoods of the respective genes in prokaryotes. Whereas eukaryotic Ago/PIWI proteins always contain PAZ (oligonucleotide binding) and PIWI (active or inactivated nuclease) domains, the prokaryotic Argonaute homologs (pAgos) fall into two major groups in which the PAZ domain is either present or absent. The monophyly of each group is supported by a phylogenetic analysis of the conserved PIWI-domains. Almost all pAgos that lack a PAZ domain appear to be inactivated, and the respective genes are associated with a variety of predicted nucleases in putative operons. An additional, uncharacterized domain that is fused to various nucleases appears to be a unique signature of operons encoding the short (lacking PAZ) pAgo form. By contrast, almost all PAZ-domain containing pAgos are predicted to be active nucleases. Some proteins of this group (e.g., that from Aquifex aeolicus) have been experimentally shown to possess nuclease activity, and are not typically associated with genes for other (putative) nucleases. Given these observations, the apparent extensive horizontal transfer of pAgo genes, and their common, statistically significant over-representation in genomic neighborhoods enriched in genes encoding proteins involved in the defense against phages and/or plasmids, we hypothesize that pAgos are key components of a novel class of defense systems. The PAZ-domain containing pAgos are predicted to directly destroy virus or plasmid nucleic acids via their nuclease activity, whereas the apparently inactivated, PAZ-lacking pAgos could be structural subunits of protein complexes that contain, as active moieties, the putative nucleases that we predict to be co-expressed with these pAgos. All these nucleases are predicted to be DNA endonucleases, so it seems most probable that the putative novel phage/plasmid-defense system targets phage DNA rather than mRNAs. Given that in eukaryotic RNAi systems, the PAZ domain binds a guide RNA and positions it on the complementary region of the target, we further speculate that pAgos function on a similar principle (the guide being either DNA or RNA), and that the uncharacterized domain found in putative operons with the short forms of pAgos is a functional substitute for the PAZ domain. CONCLUSION: The hypothesis that pAgos are key components of a novel prokaryotic immune system that employs guide RNA or DNA molecules to degrade nucleic acids of invading mobile elements implies a functional analogy with the prokaryotic CASS and a direct evolutionary connection with eukaryotic RNAi. The predictions of the hypothesis including both the activities of pAgos and those of the associated endonucleases are readily amenable to experimental tests.},

abstract = {When a field shares the consensus that a particular phenomenon does NOT occur, this may reflect extensive experimental investigations with negative outcomes, or may represent the "common sense" position based on current knowledge and established ways of thinking. The current consensus of the RNA field is that eukaryotic Argonaute (Ago) proteins employ RNA guides and target other RNAs. The alternative -- that eukaryotic Ago has biologically important interactions with DNA in vivo - has not been seriously considered, in part because the only role contemplated for DNA was as a guide strand, and in part because it did not seem plausible that any natural source of suitable DNAs exists in eukaryotic cells. However, eukaryotic Argonaute domains bind DNA in the test tube, and several articles report that small inhibitory double-stranded DNAs do have the ability to silence target RNAs in a sequence-dependent (though poorly characterized) manner. A search of the literature identified potential DNA binding partners for Ago, including (among others) single-stranded DNAs residing in extracellular vesicles, and cytoplasmic satellite-repeat DNA fragments that are associated with the plasma membrane and transcribed by Pol II. It is interesting to note that both cytoplasmic and extracellular vesicle DNA are expressed at greatly elevated levels in cancer cells relative to normal cells. In such a pathological scenario, if not under normal conditions, there may be appreciable binding of Ago to DNA despite its lower affinity compared to RNA. If so, DNA might displace Ago from binding to its normal partners (miRNAs, siRNAs and other short ncRNAs), disrupting tightly controlled post-transcriptional gene silencing processes that are vital to correct functioning of a normal cell. The possible contribution to cancer pathogenesis is a strong motivator for further investigation of Ago-DNA binding. More generally, this case underscores the need for better informatics tools to allow investigators to analyze the state of a given scientific question at a high-level and to identify possible new research directions.},

Here we report the 3.2 {\AA} crystal structure of Kluyveromyces polysporus Argonaute (KpAGO) fortuitously complexed with guide RNA originating from small-RNA duplexes autonomously loaded by recombinant KpAGO. Despite their diverse sequences, guide-RNA nucleotides 1-8 are positioned similarly, with sequence-independent contacts to bases, phosphates and 2'-hydroxyl groups pre-organizing the backbone of nucleotides 2-8 in a near-A-form conformation. Compared with prokaryotic Argonautes, KpAGO has numerous surface-exposed insertion segments, with a cluster of conserved insertions repositioning the N domain to enable full propagation of guide-target pairing. Compared with Argonautes in inactive conformations, KpAGO has a hydrogen-bond network that stabilizes an expanded and repositioned loop, which inserts an invariant glutamate into the catalytic pocket. Mutation analyses and analogies to ribonuclease H indicate that insertion of this glutamate finger completes a universally conserved catalytic tetrad, thereby activating Argonaute for RNA cleavage.},

abstract = {Improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing have underpinned comprehensive assessment of gene function in bacteria and eukaryotes. Genome-wide analyses require high-throughput methods to generate mutations and analyze their phenotypes, but approaches to date have been unable to efficiently link the effects of mutations in coding regions or promoter elements in a highly parallel fashion. We report that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in combination with massively parallel oligomer synthesis can enable trackable editing on a genome-wide scale. Our method, CRISPR-enabled trackable genome engineering (CREATE), links each guide RNA to homologous repair cassettes that both edit loci and function as barcodes to track genotype-phenotype relationships. We apply CREATE to site saturation mutagenesis for protein engineering, reconstruction of adaptive laboratory evolution experiments, and identification of stress tolerance and antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria. We provide preliminary evidence that CREATE will work in yeast. We also provide a webtool to design multiplex CREATE libraries.},

Recently characterized prokaryotic Argonaute proteins (pAgos) participate in host defense by DNA interference, whereas eukaryotic Argonaute proteins (eAgos) control a wide range of processes by RNA interference. Here we review molecular mechanisms of guide and target binding by Argonaute proteins, and describe how the conformational changes induced by target binding lead to target cleavage. On the basis of structural comparisons and phylogenetic analyses of pAgos and eAgos, we reconstruct the evolutionary journey of the Argonaute proteins through the three domains of life and discuss how different structural features of pAgos and eAgos relate to their distinct physiological roles.},

Argonaute (Ago) proteins in eukaryotes are known as key players in post-transcriptional gene silencing 1, while recent studies on prokaryotic Agos hint at their role in the protection against invading DNA 2,3. Here, we present crystal structures of the apo enzyme and a binary Ago-guide complex of the archaeal Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Mj) Ago. Binding of a guide DNA leads to large structural rearrangements. This includes the structural transformation of a hinge region contai ning a switch helix, which has been shown for human Ago2 to be critical for the dynamic target search process 4-6. To identify key residues crucial for MjAgo function, we analysed the effect of several MjAgo mutants. We observe that the nature of the 3′ and 5′ nucleotides in particular, as well as the switch helix, appear to impact MjAgo cleavage activity. In summary, we provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that drive DNA-guided DNA silencing by an archaeal Ago.},

abstract = {Drosophila Piwi-family proteins have been implicated in transposon control. Here, we examine piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) associated with each Drosophila Piwi protein and find that Piwi and Aubergine bind RNAs that are predominantly antisense to transposons, whereas Ago3 complexes contain predominantly sense piRNAs. As in mammals, the majority of Drosophila piRNAs are derived from discrete genomic loci. These loci comprise mainly defective transposon sequences, and some have previously been identified as master regulators of transposon activity. Our data suggest that heterochromatic piRNA loci interact with potentially active, euchromatic transposons to form an adaptive system for transposon control. Complementary relationships between sense and antisense piRNA populations suggest an amplification loop wherein each piRNA-directed cleavage event generates the 5′ end of a new piRNA. Thus, sense piRNAs, formed following cleavage of transposon mRNAs may enhance production of antisense piRNAs, complementary to active elements, by directing cleavage of transcripts from master control loci. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Argonaute proteins lie at the heart of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), wherein they use small RNA guides to recognize targets. Initial insight into the architecture of Argonautes came from studies of prokaryotic proteins, revealing a crescent-shaped base made up of the amino-terminal, PAZ, middle, and PIWI domains. The recently reported crystal structure of human Argonaute-2 (hAgo2), the "slicer" in RNA interference, in complex with a mixed population of RNAs derived from insect cells provides insight into the architecture of a eukaryotic Argonaute protein with defined biochemical and biological functions. Here, we report the structure of human Ago2 bound to a physiologically relevant microRNA, microRNA-20a, at 2.2 ?? resolution. The miRNA is anchored at both ends by the Mid and PAZ domains and makes several kinks and turns along the binding groove. Interestingly, miRNA binding confers remarkable stability on hAgo2, locking this otherwise flexible enzyme into a stable conformation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Several prokaryotic Argonaute proteins (pAgos) utilize small DNA guides to mediate host defense by targeting invading DNA complementary to the DNA guide. It is unknown how these DNA guides are being generated and loaded onto pAgo. Here, we demonstrate that guide-free Argonaute from Thermus thermophilus (TtAgo) can degrade double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), thereby generating small dsDNA fragments that subsequently are loaded onto TtAgo. Combining single-molecule fluorescence, molecular dynamic simulations, and structural studies, we show that TtAgo loads dsDNA molecules with a preference toward a deoxyguanosine on the passenger strand at the position opposite to the 5??? end of the guide strand. This explains why in??vivo TtAgo is preferentially loaded with guides with a 5??? end deoxycytidine. Our data demonstrate that TtAgo can independently generate and selectively load functional DNA guides.},

abstract = {Since their discovery, giant viruses have revealed several unique features that challenge the conventional definition of a virus, such as their large and complex genomes, their infection by virophages and their presence of transferable short element transpovirons. Here we investigate the sensitivity of mimivirus to virophage infection in a collection of 59 viral strains and demonstrate lineage specificity in the resistance of mimivirus to Zamilon, a unique virophage that can infect lineages B and C of mimivirus but not lineage A. We hypothesized that mimiviruses harbour a defence mechanism resembling the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas system that is widely present in bacteria and archaea. We performed de novo sequencing of 45 new mimivirus strains and searched for sequences specific to Zamilon in a total of 60 mimivirus genomes. We found that lineage A strains are resistant to Zamilon and contain the insertion of a repeated Zamilon sequence within an operon, here named the 'mimivirus virophage resistance element' (MIMIVIRE). Further analyses of the surrounding sequences showed that this locus is reminiscent of a defence mechanism related to the CRISPR-Cas system. Silencing the repeated sequence and the MIMIVIRE genes restores mimivirus susceptibility to Zamilon. The MIMIVIRE proteins possess the typical functions (nuclease and helicase) involved in the degradation of foreign nucleic acids. The viral defence system, MIMIVIRE, represents a nucleic-acid-based immunity against virophage infection.},

We report the crystal structure of Aquifex aeolicus Ago (Aa-Ago) together with binding and cleavage studies, which establish this eubacterial Ago as a bona fide guide DNA strand-mediated site-specific RNA endonuclease. We have generated a stereochemically robust model of the complex, where the guide DNA-mRNA duplex is positioned within a basic channel spanning the bilobal interface, such that the 5′ phosphate of the guide strand can be anchored in a basic pocket, and the mRNA can be positioned for site-specific cleavage by RNase H-type divalent cation-coordinated catalytic Asp residues of the PIWI domain. Domain swap experiments involving chimeras of human Ago (hAgo1) and cleavage-competent hAgo2 reinforce the role of the PIWI domain in "slicer" activity. We propose a four-step Ago-mediated catalytic cleavage cycle model, which provides distinct perspectives into the mechanism of guide strand-mediated mRNA cleavage within the RISC.
