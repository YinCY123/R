abstract = {To dissect the genetic architecture of blood pressure and assess effects on target organ damage, we analyzed 128,272 SNPs from targeted and genome-wide arrays in 201,529 individuals of European ancestry, and genotypes from an additional 140,886 individuals were used for validation. We identified 66 blood pressure-associated loci, of which 17 were new; 15 harbored multiple distinct association signals. The 66 index SNPs were enriched for cis-regulatory elements, particularly in vascular endothelial cells, consistent with a primary role in blood pressure control through modulation of vascular tone across multiple tissues. The 66 index SNPs combined in a risk score showed comparable effects in 64,421 individuals of non-European descent. The 66-SNP blood pressure risk score was significantly associated with target organ damage in multiple tissues but with minor effects in the kidney. Our findings expand current knowledge of blood pressure-related pathways and highlight tissues beyond the classical renal system in blood pressure regulation.},

abstract = {Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are essential components of the cancer microenvironment and play critical roles in the regulation of tumor progression. Optimal therapeutic intervention requires in-depth understanding of the sources that sustain macrophages in malignant tissues. In this study, we investigated the ontogeny of TAMs in murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models. We identified both inflammatory monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages as sources of TAMs. Unexpectedly, significant portions of pancreas-resident macrophages originated from embryonic development and expanded through in situ proliferation during tumor progression. Whereas monocyte-derived TAMs played more potent roles in antigen presentation, embryonically derived TAMs exhibited a pro-fibrotic transcriptional profile, indicative of their role in producing and remodeling molecules in the extracellular matrix. Collectively, these findings uncover the heterogeneity of TAM origin and functions and could provide therapeutic insight for PDAC treatment.},

abstract = {The P2X7 receptor is a non-selective cation channel activated by extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Chronic activation of P2X7 underlies many health problems such as pathologic pain, yet we lack effective antagonists due to poorly understood mechanisms of inhibition. Here we present crystal structures of a mammalian P2X7 receptor complexed with five structurally-unrelated antagonists. Unexpectedly, these drugs all bind to an allosteric site distinct from the ATP-binding pocket in a groove formed between two neighboring subunits. This novel drug-binding pocket accommodates a diversity of small molecules mainly through hydrophobic interactions. Functional assays propose that these compounds allosterically prevent narrowing of the drug-binding pocket and the turret-like architecture during channel opening, which is consistent with a site of action distal to the ATP-binding pocket. These novel mechanistic insights will facilitate the development of P2X7-specific drugs for treating human diseases.},

abstract = {The cause of most hypertensive disease is unclear, but inflammation appears critical in disease progression. However, how elevated blood pressure initiates inflammation is unknown, as are the effects of high blood pressure on innate and adaptive immune responses. We now report that hypertensive mice have increased T cell responses to antigenic challenge and develop more severe T cell–mediated immunopathology. A root cause for this is hypertension-induced erythrocyte adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) release, leading to an increase in plasma ATP levels, which begins soon after the onset of hypertension and stimulates P2X7 receptors on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), increasing APC expression of CD86. Hydrolyzing ATP or blocking the P2X7 receptor eliminated hypertension-induced T cell hyperactivation. In addition, pharmacologic or genetic blockade of P2X7 receptor activity suppressed the progression of hypertension. Consistent with the results in mice, we also found that untreated human hypertensive patients have significantly elevated plasma ATP levels compared with treated hypertensive patients or normotensive controls. Thus, a hypertension-induced increase in extracellular ATP triggers augmented APC and T cell function and contributes to the immune-mediated pathologic changes associated with hypertensive disease.},

abstract = {Low-grade, chronic inflammation has been associated with many diseases of aging, but the mechanisms responsible for producing this inflammation remain unclear. Inflammasomes can drive chronic inflammation in the context of an infectious disease or cellular stress, and they trigger the maturation of interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$). Here we find that the expression of specific inflammasome gene modules stratifies older individuals into two extremes: those with constitutive expression of IL-1$\beta$, nucleotide metabolism dysfunction, elevated oxidative stress, high rates of hypertension and arterial stiffness; and those without constitutive expression of IL-1$\beta$, who lack these characteristics. Adenine and N(4)-acetylcytidine, nucleotide-derived metabolites that are detectable in the blood of the former group, prime and activate the NLRC4 inflammasome, induce the production of IL-1$\beta$, activate platelets and neutrophils and elevate blood pressure in mice. In individuals over 85 years of age, the elevated expression of inflammasome gene modules was associated with all-cause mortality. Thus, targeting inflammasome components may ameliorate chronic inflammation and various other age-associated conditions.},

abstract = {Chemokines and their receptors such as CCR2 and CX3CR1 mediate leukocyte adhesion and migration into injured tissue. To further define mechanisms of monocyte trafficking during kidney injury we identified two groups of F4/80-positive cells (F4/80low and F4/80high) in the normal mouse kidney that phenotypically correspond to macrophages and dendritic cells, respectively. Following ischemia and 3 h of reperfusion, there was a large influx of F4/80low inflamed monocytes, but not dendritic cells, into the kidney. These monocytes produced TNF-$\alpha$, IL-6, IL-1$\alpha$ and IL-12. Ischemic injury induced in CCR2-/- mice or in CCR2 +/+ mice, made chimeric with CCR2-/- bone marrow, resulted in lower plasma creatinine levels and their kidneys had fewer infiltrated F4/80low macrophages compared to control mice. CX3CR1 expression contributed to monocyte recruitment into inflamed kidneys, as ischemic injury in CX3CR1-/- mice was reduced, with fewer F4/80low macrophages than controls. Monocytes transferred from CCR2+/+ or CX3CR1+/- mice migrated into reperfused kidneys better than monocytes from either CCR2-/- or CX3CR1-/- mice. Adoptive transfer of monocytes from CCR2+/+ mice, but not CCR2-/- mice, reversed the protective effect in CCR2-/- mice following ischemia-reperfusion. Egress of CD11b+Ly6Chigh monocytes from blood into inflamed kidneys was CCR2- and CX3CR1-dependent. Our study shows that inflamed monocyte migration, through CCR2- and CX3CR1-dependent mechanisms, plays a critical role in kidney injury following ischemia reperfusion. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Society of Nephrology.},

abstract = {P2X receptors are trimeric ATP-activated ion channels permeable to Na+, K+ and Ca2+. The seven P2X receptor subtypes are implicated in physiological processes that include modulation of synaptic transmission, contraction of smooth muscle, secretion of chemical transmitters and regulation of immune responses. Despite the importance of P2X receptors in cellular physiology, the three-dimensional composition of the ATP-binding site, the structural mechanism of ATP-dependent ion channel gating and the architecture of the open ion channel pore are unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the zebrafish P2X4 receptor in complex with ATP and a new structure of the apo receptor. The agonist-bound structure reveals a previously unseen ATP-binding motif and an open ion channel pore. ATP binding induces cleft closure of the nucleotide-binding pocket, flexing of the lower body $\beta$-sheet and a radial expansion of the extracellular vestibule. The structural widening of the extracellular vestibule is directly coupled to the opening of the ion channel pore by way of an iris-like expansion of the transmembrane helices. The structural delineation of the ATP-binding site and the ion channel pore, together with the conformational changes associated with ion channel gating, will stimulate development of new pharmacological agents.},

However, Salmonella typhimurium that are deficient in invasion genes encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island I (SP11) are still able to reach the spleen after oral administration. This suggests the existence of an alternative route for bacterial invasion, one that is independent of M cells. We report here a new mechanism for bacterial uptake in the mucosa tissues that is mediated by dendritic cells (DCs). DCs open the tight junctions between epithelial cells, send dendrites outside the epithelium and directly sample bacteria. In addition, because DCs express tight-junction proteins such as occludin, claudin 1 and zonula occludens 1, the integrity of the epithelial barrier is preserved.},

The proteins in each complex are identified using cryoID, a program we developed to identify proteins in ab initio cryoEM maps. As a proof of principle, we applied this approach to the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum, an organism that has resisted conventional structural-biology approaches, to obtain atomic models of multiple protein complexes implicated in intraerythrocytic survival of the parasite. Our approach is broadly applicable for determining structures of undiscovered protein complexes enriched directly from endogenous sources.},

abstract = {Aims: Many studies have estimated the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) but results have varied due partly to the type of equation used to estimate GFR, type of subjects, and ethnicity. This review aimed to estimate the prevalence of CKD Stage III, accounting for these factors. Methods: 403 studies were identified from Medline using the PubMed search engine, of which 34 studies were eligible. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers, and heterogeneity was assessed using metaregression. Results: The pooled prevalence was estimated using a random effects model. In the general population, the prevalences of CKD Stage III using MDRD equation were 3.6{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2.5, 4.8), 10.7{\%} (95{\%} CI: 4.5-16.9{\%}), and 16.3{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2.1-30.5{\%}) for age groups ≤ 50, 50-60 and {\textgreater} 60 years. The prevalence was about double using the Cockcroft-Gault equations, i.e. 7.5{\%} (95{\%} CI: 6.9-8.2{\%}) and 34.9 (95{\%} CI: 25.9-44.8{\%}) in age ≤ 50 and {\textgreater} 50 years, respectively. The prevalence was similar in Caucasians and Asians aged ≤ 60, i.e. 9.9 versus 9.3{\%}. The prevalence was also higher in the diabetic population than in the general population, i.e. 18.2{\%} versus 10.6{\%}. Conclusions: The pooled prevalence of CKD in the general population varied according to age groups. The prevalence is similar in Caucasians and Asians within age 60 years or younger but other age groups need more studies in order to pool. Individual patient meta-analysis would be appropriate to resolve the causes of heterogeneity. {\textcopyright} 2009 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K. Feistle.},

abstract = {Lower urinary tract infections are among the most common human bacterial infections, but extension to the kidneys is rare. This has been attributed to mechanical forces, such as urine flow, that prevent the ascent of bladder microbes. Here, we show that the regional hypersalinity, required for the kidney's urine-concentrating function, instructs epithelial cells to produce chemokines that localize monocyte-derived mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to the medulla. This hypersaline environment also increases the intrinsic bactericidal and neutrophil chemotactic activities of MNPs to generate a zone of defense. Because MNP positioning and function are dynamically regulated by the renal salt gradient, we find that patients with urinary concentrating defects are susceptible to kidney infection. Our work reveals a critical accessory role for the homeostatic function of a vital organ in optimizing tissue defense.},

abstract = {The nucleotide receptor P2X7 has been shown to modulate LPS-induced macrophage production of numerous inflammatory mediators. Although the C-terminal portion of P2X7 is thought to be essential for multiple receptor functions, little is known regarding the structural motifs that lie within this region. We show here that the P2X7 C-terminal domain contains several apparent protein-protein and protein-lipid interaction motifs with potential importance to macrophage signaling and LPS action. Surprisingly, P2X7 also contains a conserved LPS-binding domain. In this report, we demonstrate that peptides derived from this P2X7 sequence bind LPS in vitro. Moreover, these peptides neutralize the ability of LPS to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1, ERK2) and to promote the degradation of the inhibitor of kappaB-alpha isoform (IkappaB-alpha) in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Collectively, these data suggest that the C-terminal domain of P2X7 may directly coordinate several signal transduction events related to macrophage function and LPS action.},

abstract = {P2X receptors are cation selective ion channels gated by extracellular ATP and implicated in diverse physiological processes, from synaptic transmission to inflammation to the sensing of taste and pain. Because P2X receptors are not related to other ion channel proteins of known structure, there is presently no molecular foundation for mechanisms of ligand-gating, allosteric modulation and ion permeation. Here we present crystal structures of the zebrafish P2X4 receptor in its closed, resting state. The chalice-shaped, trimeric receptor is knit together by subunit-subunit contacts implicated in ion channel gating and receptor assembly. Extracellular domains, rich in $\beta$-strands, have large acidic patches that may attract cations, through fenestrations, to vestibules near the ion channel. Within the transmembrane pore, the ‘gate' is defined by an {\~{}}8 Ǻ slab of protein. We define the location of three non-canonical, intersubunit ATP binding sites and suggest that ATP binding promotes subunit rearrangement and ion channel opening.},

abstract = {We used Bayesian regularized neural networks to model data on the MHC class II-binding affinity of peptides. Training data consisted of sequences and binding data for nonamer (nine amino acid) peptides. Independent test data consisted of sequences and binding data for peptides of length ≤25. We assumed that MHC class II-binding activity of peptides depends only on the highest ranked embedded nonamer and that reverse sequences of active nonamers are inactive. We also internally validated the models by using 30{\%} of the training data in an internal test set. We obtained robust models, with near identical statistics for multiple training runs. We determined how predictive our models were using statistical tests and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) graphs (AROC). Most models gave training A ROC values close to 1.0 and test set AROC values {\textgreater}0.8. We also used both amino acid indicator variables (bin20) and property-based descriptors to generate models for MHC class II-binding of peptides. The property-based descriptors were more parsimonious than the indicator variable descriptors, making them applicable to larger peptides, and their design makes them able to generalize to unknown peptides outside of the training space. None of the external test data sets contained any of the nonamer sequences in the training sets. Consequently, the models attempted to predict the activity of truly unknown peptides not encountered in the training sets. Our models were well able to tackle the difficult problem of correctly predicting the MHC class II-binding activities of a majority of the test set peptides. Exceptions to the assumption that nonamer motif activities were invariant to the peptide in which they were embedded, together with the limited coverage of the test data, and the fuzziness of the classification procedure, are likely explanations for some misclassifications. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we identify a myeloid-derived mucosal DC in mice, which populates the entire lamina propria of the small intestine. Lamina propria DCs were found to depend on the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 to form transepithelial dendrites, which enable the cells to directly sample luminal antigens. CX3CR1 was also found to control the clearance of entero-invasive pathogens by DCs. Thus, CX 3CR1-dependent processes, which control host interactions of specialized DCs with commensal and pathogenic bacteria, may regulate immunological tolerance and inflammation.},

abstract = {Macrophages are strongly adapted to their tissue of residence. Yet, little is known about the cell-cell interactions that imprint the tissue-specific identities of macrophages in their respective niches. Using conditional depletion of liver Kupffer cells, we traced the developmental stages of monocytes differentiating into Kupffer cells and mapped the cellular interactions imprinting the Kupffer cell identity. Kupffer cell loss induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-dependent activation of stellate cells and endothelial cells, resulting in the transient production of chemokines and adhesion molecules orchestrating monocyte engraftment. Engrafted circulating monocytes transmigrated into the perisinusoidal space and acquired the liver-associated transcription factors inhibitor of DNA 3 (ID3) and liver X receptor-$\alpha$ (LXR-$\alpha$). Coordinated interactions with hepatocytes induced ID3 expression, whereas endothelial cells and stellate cells induced LXR-$\alpha$ via a synergistic NOTCH-BMP pathway. This study shows that the Kupffer cell niche is composed of stellate cells, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells that together imprint the liver-specific macrophage identity.},

These ubiquitous eukaryotic ion channels have essential roles in biological activities as diverse as sodium homeostasis, taste and pain. Despite their crucial roles in biology and their unusual trimeric subunit stoichiometry, there is little knowledge of the structural and chemical principles underlying their ion channel architecture and ion-binding sites. Here we present the structure of a functional acid-sensing ion channel in a desensitized state at 3 A resolution, the location and composition of the approximately 8 A 'thick' desensitization gate, and the trigonal antiprism coordination of caesium ions bound in the extracellular vestibule. Comparison of the acid-sensing ion channel structure with the ATP-gated P2X(4) receptor reveals similarity in pore architecture and aqueous vestibules, suggesting that there are unanticipated yet common structural and mechanistic principles.},

abstract = {In order to survey a universe of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-presented peptide antigens whose numbers greatly exceed the diversity of the T cell repertoire, T cell receptors (TCRs) are thought to be cross-reactive. However, the nature and extent of TCR cross-reactivity has not been conclusively measured experimentally. We developed a system to identify MHC-presented peptide ligands by combining TCR selection of highly diverse yeast-displayed peptide-MHC libraries with deep sequencing. Although we identified hundreds of peptides reactive with each of five different mouse and human TCRs, the selected peptides possessed TCR recognition motifs that bore a close resemblance to their known antigens. This structural conservation of the TCR interaction surface allowed us to exploit deep-sequencing information to computationally identify activating microbial and self-ligands for human autoimmune TCRs. The mechanistic basis of TCR cross-reactivity described here enables effective surveillance of diverse self and foreign antigens without necessitating degenerate recognition of nonhomologous peptides. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {P2X receptors are non-selective cation channels gated by extracellular ATP, and the P2X7 receptor subtype plays a crucial role in the immune and nervous systems. Altered expression and dysfunctions of P2X7 receptors caused by genetic deletions, mutations, and polymorphic variations have been linked to various diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension. Despite the availability of crystal structures of P2X receptors, the mechanism of competitive antagonist action for P2X receptors remains controversial. Here, we determine the crystal structure of the chicken P2X7 receptor in complex with the competitive P2X antagonist, TNP-ATP. The structure reveals an expanded, incompletely activated conformation of the channel, and identified the unique recognition manner of TNP-ATP, which is distinct from that observed in the previously determined human P2X3 receptor structure. A structure-based computational analysis furnishes mechanistic insights into the TNP-ATP-dependent inhibition. Our work provides structural insights into the functional mechanism of the P2X competitive antagonist.},
