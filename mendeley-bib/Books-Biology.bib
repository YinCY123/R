@book{Lauren2016,
abstract = {How the Immune System Works is not a comprehensive textbook. It's the book thousands of students have used to help them understand what's in their big, thick, immunology texts. In this book, Dr. Sompayrac cuts through the jargon and details to reveal, in simple language, the essence of this complex subject.Fifteen easy to follow lectures, featuring the uniquely popular humorous style and engaging analogies developed by Dr Sompayrac, provide an introduction to the ‘bigger picture', followed by practical discussion on how each of the components interacts with one another. Now featuring full-color diagrams, this book has been rigorously updated for its fourth edition to reflect today's immunology teaching and includes updated discussion of B and T cell memory, T cell activation, vaccines, immunodeficiency, and cancer.Whether you are completely new to immunology, or require a refresher, How the Immune System Works is an enjoyable way of engaging with the key concepts – you need know nothing of the workings of the immune system to benefit from this book!How the Immune System Works is now accompanied by a FREE enhanced Wiley Desktop Edition - the interactive, digital version of the book - featuring downloadable text and images, highlighting and note taking facilities, book-marking, cross-referencing, in-text searching, and linking to references and glossary terms. It is also available from CourseSmart for instant, online and offline access for studying anytime, anywhere.},

@book{KHALIL2016a,
abstract = {The vascular system plays an important role in the distribution ofblood and nutrient supply to different tissues and organs. It comprises a vast and intricate network oflarge and small, superficial and deep arteries and veins. Structur- ally, a blood vessel is composed ofthree layers: the intima and endothelium, the media and vascular smooth muscle, and the adventitia and extracellular matrix. Each ofthese layers has a specific role in order to maintain the blood vessel diameter and to handle the changes in blood pressure. Interestingly, the blood vessel wall is lined with only one layer of endothelial cells. However, this single layer of cells is capable of releasing several relaxing factors including nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and hyperpolarizing factor that could promote vasodilation and decrease vascular resistance and blood pressure. Endothelial cells also release powerful contracting factors such as endothelin and thromboxane A2 with multiple targets in the blood vessels and other tissues, an important role in the control of the circulation, the hemodynamics, and cardiovascular and renal function. An imbalance between endothelium-derived vasodilators and vasoconstrictors could cause pathological changes that lead to major disorders such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes.},

abstract = {Molecular Biology is a rapidly advancing field with a constant flow of new information and cutting-edge developements that impact our lives. Lewin's GENES has long been the essential resource for providing the teaching community with the most modern presentation to this dynamic area of study. GENES XI continues this tradition by introducing the most current data from the field, covering gene structure, sequencing, organization, and expression. It has enlisted a wealth of subject-matter experts, from top institutions, to provide content updates and revisions in their individual areas of study. A reorganized chapter presentation provides a clear, more student-friendly introduction to course material than ever before. - Updated content throughout to keep pace with this fast-paced field.- Reorganized chapter presentation provides a clear, student-friendly introduction to course material.- Expanded coverage describing the connection between replication and the cell cycle is included, and presents eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes.- Available with new online Molecular Biology Animations.- Online access code for the companion website is included with every new book. The companion website offers numerous study aids and learning tools to help students get the most out of their course.- Instructor's supplements include: PowerPoint Image Bank, PowerPoint Lecture Slides, and Test Bank.},
