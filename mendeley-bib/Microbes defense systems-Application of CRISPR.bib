abstract = {Improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing have underpinned comprehensive assessment of gene function in bacteria and eukaryotes. Genome-wide analyses require high-throughput methods to generate mutations and analyze their phenotypes, but approaches to date have been unable to efficiently link the effects of mutations in coding regions or promoter elements in a highly parallel fashion. We report that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in combination with massively parallel oligomer synthesis can enable trackable editing on a genome-wide scale. Our method, CRISPR-enabled trackable genome engineering (CREATE), links each guide RNA to homologous repair cassettes that both edit loci and function as barcodes to track genotype-phenotype relationships. We apply CREATE to site saturation mutagenesis for protein engineering, reconstruction of adaptive laboratory evolution experiments, and identification of stress tolerance and antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria. We provide preliminary evidence that CREATE will work in yeast. We also provide a webtool to design multiplex CREATE libraries.},

@article{Gaudelli2017a,
abstract = {The spontaneous deamination of cytosine is a major source of C•G to T•A transitions, which account for half of known human pathogenic point mutations. The ability to efficiently convert target A•T base pairs to G•C could therefore advance the study and treatment of genetic diseases. While the deamination of adenine yields inosine, which is treated as guanine by polymerases, no enzymes are known to deaminate adenine in DNA. Here we report adenine base editors (ABEs) that mediate conversion of A•T to G•C in genomic DNA. We evolved a tRNA adenosine deaminase to operate on DNA when fused to a catalytically impaired CRISPR-Cas9. Extensive directed evolution and protein engineering resulted in seventh- generation ABEs ( e.g. , ABE7.10), that convert target A•T to G•C base pairs efficiently ( {\~{}} 50{\%} in human cells) with very high product purity (typically ≥ 99.9{\%}) and very low rates of indels (typically ≤ 0.1{\%}). ABEs introduce point mutations more efficiently and cleanly than a current Cas9 nuclease-based method, induce less off-target genome modification than Cas9, and can install disease-correcting or disease-suppressing mutations in human cells. Together with our previous base editors, ABEs advance genome editing by enabling the direct, programmable introduction of all four transition mutations without double-stranded DNA cleavage.},
