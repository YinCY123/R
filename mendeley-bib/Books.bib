@book{Nagarajan2013a,
abstract = {While there have been significant advances in capturing data from the entities across complex real-world systems, their associations and relationships are largely unknown. Associations between the entities may reveal interesting system-level properties that may not be apparent otherwise. Often these associations are hypothesized by superimposing knowledge across distinct reductionist representations of these entities obtained from disparate sources. Such representations, while useful, may provide only an incomplete picture of the associations. This can be attributed to their dependence on prior knowledge and failure of the principle of superposition in general. Such representations may also be unhelpful in discovering novel undocumented associations. A more rigorous approach would be to identify associations from data measured simultaneously across the entities of interest from a given system. These data sets or digital signatures are quantized in time and amplitude and in turn may (dynamic) or may not (static) contain explicit temporal information. Symmetric measures such as correlation have been helpful in modeling direct associations as undirected graphs. However, it is well appreciated that the association between a given pair of entities may be indirect and often mediated through others. Symmetric measures are also immune to the direction of association by their very definition. Graphical models such as Bayesian networks have especially proven to be useful in this regard. The vertices (nodes) represent the entities of interest, the arcs (edges) represent their associations, and the entire Bayesian network represents the joint probability distribution between the entities of interest. Bayesian networks networks. It introduces the reader to structure and parameter learning from multiple independent realizations of data sets without explicit temporal information. Such data sets are quite common and represent a snapshot of the process. The impact of discretization on the network inference with application to molecular expression data is also discussed. The lack of temporal information implicitly excludes the presence of feedback or cycles, resulting in a directed acyclic graphical representation of the associations between the entities. These limitations are overcome by learning networks from data sets with explicit temporal signatures. In Chap. 3, we discuss the usefulness of dynamic Bayesian networks for learning the network structure in the presence of explicit temporal information such as multivariate time series. Homogeneous and nonhomogeneous dynamic Bayesian networks are discussed. In Chap. 4, static and dynamic Bayesian network inference methods are discussed. Some of the network learning algorithms discussed in the earlier chapters are computationally intensive limiting their usefulness across large and high-dimensional data sets. Parallelization options for some of the algorithms discussed in the earlier chapters are discussed in Chap. 5 to overcome some of these limitations.},

abstract = {Angiostrongylus cantonensis is an emerging infectious agent causing eosinophilic meningitis or meningoencephalitis in humans with clinical manifestation of severe headache. Molecular genetic studies on classification and phylogeny of A. cantonensis in Thailand are limited. This study surveyed A. cantonensis larvae prevalence in natural intermediate hosts across Thailand and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships. A total of 14,032 freshwater and land snails were collected from 19 provinces of Thailand. None of Filopaludina sp, Pomacea sp, and Cyclophorus sp were infected with Angiostrongylus larvae, whereas Achatina fulica, Cryptozona siamensis, and Megaustenia siamensis collected from Kalasin, Kamphaeng Phet, Phetchabun, Phitsanulok, and Tak Provinces were infected, with C. siamensis being the common intermediate host. Based on morphology, larvae isolated from 11 samples of these naturally infected snails preliminarily were identified as A. cantonensis. Comparison of partial nucleotide sequences of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene revealed that four sequences are identical to A. cantonensis haplotype ac4 from Bangkok and the other seven to that of A. cantonensis isolate AC Thai, indicating two independent lineages of A. cantonensis in Thailand.},

abstract = {New technologies have enabled the investigation of biology and human health at an unprecedented scale and in multiple dimen-sions. These dimensions include myriad properties describing genome, epigenome, transcriptome, microbiome, phenotype, and lifestyle. No single data type, however, can capture the complexity of all the factors relevant to understanding a phenomenon such as a disease. Integrative methods that combine data from multiple technologies have thus emerged as critical statistical and computational approaches. The key challenge in developing such approaches is the identification of effective models to provide a comprehensive and relevant systems view. An ideal method can answer a biological or medical question, identifying important fea-tures and predicting outcomes, by harnessing heterogeneous data across several dimensions of biological variation. In this Review, we describe the principles of data integration and discuss current methods and available implementations. We provide examples of successful data integration in biology and medicine. Finally, we discuss current challenges in biomedical integrative methods and our perspective on the future development of the field.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The vascular system plays an important role in the distribution ofblood and nutrient supply to different tissues and organs. It comprises a vast and intricate network oflarge and small, superficial and deep arteries and veins. Structur- ally, a blood vessel is composed ofthree layers: the intima and endothelium, the media and vascular smooth muscle, and the adventitia and extracellular matrix. Each ofthese layers has a specific role in order to maintain the blood vessel diameter and to handle the changes in blood pressure. Interestingly, the blood vessel wall is lined with only one layer of endothelial cells. However, this single layer of cells is capable of releasing several relaxing factors including nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and hyperpolarizing factor that could promote vasodilation and decrease vascular resistance and blood pressure. Endothelial cells also release powerful contracting factors such as endothelin and thromboxane A2 with multiple targets in the blood vessels and other tissues, an important role in the control of the circulation, the hemodynamics, and cardiovascular and renal function. An imbalance between endothelium-derived vasodilators and vasoconstrictors could cause pathological changes that lead to major disorders such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

@book{J.Faraway2006,
abstract = {Linear models are central to the practice of statistics. They are part of the core knowledge expected of any applied statistician. Linear models are the foundation of a broad range of statistical methodologies; this book is a survey of techniques that grow from a linear model. Our starting point is the regression model with response y and predictors x1,...xp. The model takes the form: y=$\beta$0+$\beta$1x1+...+$\beta$pxp+$\epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is normally distributed. This book presents three extensions to this framework. The first generalizes the y part; the second, the $\epsilon$ part; and the third, the x part of the linear model. Generalized Linear Models: The standard linear model cannot handle nonnormal responses, y, such as counts or proportions. This motivates the development of generalized linear models that can represent categorical, binary and other response types. Mixed Effect Models: Some data has a grouped, nested or hierarchical structure. Repeated measures, longitudinal and multilevel data consist of several observations taken on the same individual or group. This induces a correlation structure in the error, $\epsilon$. Mixed effect models allow the modeling of such data. Nonparametric Regression Models: In the linear model, the predictors, x, are combined in a linear way to model the effect on the response. Sometimes this linearity is insufficient to capture the structure of the data and more flexibility is required. Methods such as additive models, trees and neural networks allow a more flexible regression modeling of the response that combine the predictors in a nonparametric manner. This book aims to provide the reader with a well-stocked toolbox of statistical methodologies. A practicing statistician needs to be aware of and familiar with the basic use of a broad range of ideas and techniques. This book will be a success if the reader is able to recognize and get started on a wide range of problems. However, the breadth comes at the expense of some depth. Fortunately, there are book-length treatments of topics discussed in every chapter of this book, so the reader will know where to go next if needed. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It runs on a wide variety of platforms including the Windows, Linux and Macintosh operating systems. Although there are several excellent statistical packages, only R is both free and possesses the power to perform the analyses demonstrated in this book. While it is possible in principle to learn statistical methods from purely theoretical expositions, I believe most readers learn best from the demonstrated interplay of theory and practice. The data analysis of real examples is woven into this book and all the R commands necessary to reproduce the analyses are provided.},

@book{Guttag2016a,
abstract = {Second edition. Includes index. This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of data science for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in a massive open online course (MOOC). This new edition has been updated for Python 3, reorganized to make it easier to use for courses that cover only a subset of the material, and offers additional material including five new chapters. Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming. This edition offers expanded material on statistics and machine learning and new chapters on Frequentist and Bayesian statistics.-- Preface -- 1. Introduction -- 2. Introduction to Python.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Identifying interesting relationships between pairs of variables in large data sets is increasingly important. Here, we present a measure of dependence for two-variable relationships: the maximal information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide range of associations both functional and not, and for functional relationships provides a score that roughly equals the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) of the data relative to the regression function. MIC belongs to a larger class of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics for identifying and classifying relationships. We apply MIC and MINE to data sets in global health, gene expression, major-league baseball, and the human gut microbiota and identify known and novel relationships.},
