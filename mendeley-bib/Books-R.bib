@book{J.Faraway2006,
abstract = {Linear models are central to the practice of statistics. They are part of the core knowledge expected of any applied statistician. Linear models are the foundation of a broad range of statistical methodologies; this book is a survey of techniques that grow from a linear model. Our starting point is the regression model with response y and predictors x1,...xp. The model takes the form: y=$\beta$0+$\beta$1x1+...+$\beta$pxp+$\epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is normally distributed. This book presents three extensions to this framework. The first generalizes the y part; the second, the $\epsilon$ part; and the third, the x part of the linear model. Generalized Linear Models: The standard linear model cannot handle nonnormal responses, y, such as counts or proportions. This motivates the development of generalized linear models that can represent categorical, binary and other response types. Mixed Effect Models: Some data has a grouped, nested or hierarchical structure. Repeated measures, longitudinal and multilevel data consist of several observations taken on the same individual or group. This induces a correlation structure in the error, $\epsilon$. Mixed effect models allow the modeling of such data. Nonparametric Regression Models: In the linear model, the predictors, x, are combined in a linear way to model the effect on the response. Sometimes this linearity is insufficient to capture the structure of the data and more flexibility is required. Methods such as additive models, trees and neural networks allow a more flexible regression modeling of the response that combine the predictors in a nonparametric manner. This book aims to provide the reader with a well-stocked toolbox of statistical methodologies. A practicing statistician needs to be aware of and familiar with the basic use of a broad range of ideas and techniques. This book will be a success if the reader is able to recognize and get started on a wide range of problems. However, the breadth comes at the expense of some depth. Fortunately, there are book-length treatments of topics discussed in every chapter of this book, so the reader will know where to go next if needed. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It runs on a wide variety of platforms including the Windows, Linux and Macintosh operating systems. Although there are several excellent statistical packages, only R is both free and possesses the power to perform the analyses demonstrated in this book. While it is possible in principle to learn statistical methods from purely theoretical expositions, I believe most readers learn best from the demonstrated interplay of theory and practice. The data analysis of real examples is woven into this book and all the R commands necessary to reproduce the analyses are provided.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@book{Nagarajan2013a,
abstract = {While there have been significant advances in capturing data from the entities across complex real-world systems, their associations and relationships are largely unknown. Associations between the entities may reveal interesting system-level properties that may not be apparent otherwise. Often these associations are hypothesized by superimposing knowledge across distinct reductionist representations of these entities obtained from disparate sources. Such representations, while useful, may provide only an incomplete picture of the associations. This can be attributed to their dependence on prior knowledge and failure of the principle of superposition in general. Such representations may also be unhelpful in discovering novel undocumented associations. A more rigorous approach would be to identify associations from data measured simultaneously across the entities of interest from a given system. These data sets or digital signatures are quantized in time and amplitude and in turn may (dynamic) or may not (static) contain explicit temporal information. Symmetric measures such as correlation have been helpful in modeling direct associations as undirected graphs. However, it is well appreciated that the association between a given pair of entities may be indirect and often mediated through others. Symmetric measures are also immune to the direction of association by their very definition. Graphical models such as Bayesian networks have especially proven to be useful in this regard. The vertices (nodes) represent the entities of interest, the arcs (edges) represent their associations, and the entire Bayesian network represents the joint probability distribution between the entities of interest. Bayesian networks networks. It introduces the reader to structure and parameter learning from multiple independent realizations of data sets without explicit temporal information. Such data sets are quite common and represent a snapshot of the process. The impact of discretization on the network inference with application to molecular expression data is also discussed. The lack of temporal information implicitly excludes the presence of feedback or cycles, resulting in a directed acyclic graphical representation of the associations between the entities. These limitations are overcome by learning networks from data sets with explicit temporal signatures. In Chap. 3, we discuss the usefulness of dynamic Bayesian networks for learning the network structure in the presence of explicit temporal information such as multivariate time series. Homogeneous and nonhomogeneous dynamic Bayesian networks are discussed. In Chap. 4, static and dynamic Bayesian network inference methods are discussed. Some of the network learning algorithms discussed in the earlier chapters are computationally intensive limiting their usefulness across large and high-dimensional data sets. Parallelization options for some of the algorithms discussed in the earlier chapters are discussed in Chap. 5 to overcome some of these limitations.},

@book{Wickham2016,
abstract = {Angiostrongylus cantonensis is an emerging infectious agent causing eosinophilic meningitis or meningoencephalitis in humans with clinical manifestation of severe headache. Molecular genetic studies on classification and phylogeny of A. cantonensis in Thailand are limited. This study surveyed A. cantonensis larvae prevalence in natural intermediate hosts across Thailand and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships. A total of 14,032 freshwater and land snails were collected from 19 provinces of Thailand. None of Filopaludina sp, Pomacea sp, and Cyclophorus sp were infected with Angiostrongylus larvae, whereas Achatina fulica, Cryptozona siamensis, and Megaustenia siamensis collected from Kalasin, Kamphaeng Phet, Phetchabun, Phitsanulok, and Tak Provinces were infected, with C. siamensis being the common intermediate host. Based on morphology, larvae isolated from 11 samples of these naturally infected snails preliminarily were identified as A. cantonensis. Comparison of partial nucleotide sequences of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene revealed that four sequences are identical to A. cantonensis haplotype ac4 from Bangkok and the other seven to that of A. cantonensis isolate AC Thai, indicating two independent lineages of A. cantonensis in Thailand.},
