abstract = {Angiogenesis involves dynamic interactions between specialized endothelial tip and stalk cells that are believed to be regulated in part by VEGF and Dll4-Notch signaling. However, our understanding of this process is hampered by limited knowledge of the heterogeneity of endothelial cells and the role of different signaling pathways in specifying endothelial phenotypes. Here, we characterized by single-cell transcriptomics the heterogeneity of mouse endothelial cells and other stromal cells during active angiogenesis in xenograft tumors as well as from adult normal heart, following pharmacologic inhibition of VEGF and Dll4-Notch signaling. We classified tumor endothelial cells into three subpopulations that appeared to correspond with tip-like, transition, and stalk-like cells. Previously identified markers for tip and stalk cells were confirmed and several novel ones discovered. Blockade of VEGF rapidly inhibited cell-cycle genes and strongly reduced the proportion of endothelial tip cells in tumors. In contrast, blockade of Dll4 promoted endothelial proliferation as well as tip cell markers; blockade of both pathways inhibited endothelial proliferation but preserved some tip cells. We also phenotypically classified other tumor stromal cells and found that tumor-associated fibroblasts responded to antiangiogenic drug treatments by upregulating hypoxia-associated genes and producing secreted factors involved in angiogenesis. Overall, our findings better define the heterogeneity of tumor endothelial and other stromal cells and reveal the roles of VEGF and Dll4-Notch in specifying tumor endothelial phenotype, highlighting the response of stromal cells to antiangiogenic therapies. Significance: These findings provide a framework for defining subpopulations of endothelial cells and tumor-associated fibroblasts and their rapid changes in gene expression following antiangiogenic treatment.},

abstract = {The vascular system plays an important role in the distribution ofblood and nutrient supply to different tissues and organs. It comprises a vast and intricate network oflarge and small, superficial and deep arteries and veins. Structur- ally, a blood vessel is composed ofthree layers: the intima and endothelium, the media and vascular smooth muscle, and the adventitia and extracellular matrix. Each ofthese layers has a specific role in order to maintain the blood vessel diameter and to handle the changes in blood pressure. Interestingly, the blood vessel wall is lined with only one layer of endothelial cells. However, this single layer of cells is capable of releasing several relaxing factors including nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and hyperpolarizing factor that could promote vasodilation and decrease vascular resistance and blood pressure. Endothelial cells also release powerful contracting factors such as endothelin and thromboxane A2 with multiple targets in the blood vessels and other tissues, an important role in the control of the circulation, the hemodynamics, and cardiovascular and renal function. An imbalance between endothelium-derived vasodilators and vasoconstrictors could cause pathological changes that lead to major disorders such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes.},

@article{Rohlenova2020,
abstract = {Endothelial cell (EC) metabolism is an emerging target for anti-angiogenic therapy in tumor angiogenesis and choroidal neovascularization (CNV), but little is known about individual EC metabolic transcriptomes. By single-cell RNA sequencing 28,337 murine choroidal ECs (CECs) and sprouting CNV-ECs, we constructed a taxonomy to characterize their heterogeneity. Comparison with murine lung tumor ECs (TECs) revealed congruent marker gene expression by distinct EC phenotypes across tissues and diseases, suggesting similar angiogenic mechanisms. Trajectory inference predicted that differentiation of venous to angiogenic ECs was accompanied by metabolic transcriptome plasticity. ECs displayed metabolic transcriptome heterogeneity during cell-cycle progression and in quiescence. Hypothesizing that conserved genes are important, we used an integrated analysis, based on congruent transcriptome analysis, CEC-tailored genome-scale metabolic modeling, and gene expression meta-analysis in cross-species datasets, followed by in vitro and in vivo validation, to identify SQLE and ALDH18A1 as previously unknown metabolic angiogenic targets.},
