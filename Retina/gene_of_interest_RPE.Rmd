# characters of choriocapillaris  

+ vascular endothelial growth factor-A level is negatively correlated with choriocapillaris vascular density  

+ choriocapillaris thining is accompanied by changes in the levels of protease inhibitors with increased collagen and decreased ground substance.  

+ subfoveal blood flow slower and decreased choroidal volume with progression of AMD   

+ MAC is major deposition at the choriocapillaris during aging and AMD  

+ choriodal thining is accompanied by a shift in protease inhibitos with increased serine protease inhibitor in thick choriods and increase matrix metalloprotease inhibitors in thin chorids  

+ alkaline phosphatase activity is a better marker than CD34 in aging and AMD choriocapillaris
