**all igraph's parameter is here!!**  
```{r}
?igraph.plotting
```

The discription of an `igraph` object starts with up to four letters  
```
- D or U for a directed or undirected graph  
- N for a named graph (where nodes have a name attribute)  
- W for a weighted graph (where edges have a weight attribute)  
- B for a bipartite (two-mode) graph (where nodes have a type attribute)  
```

```
(g/c) - graph-level character attribute  
(v/c) - vertex-level character attribute  
(e/n) - edge-level numeric attru=ibute 
```


# Networks in igraph  
```{r}
g1 <- graph(edges = c(1,2, 2,3, 3, 1), n = 3, directed = F)
plot(g1)
```

```{r}
class(g1)
g1
```


```{r}
g2 <- graph( edges=c(1,2, 2,3, 3, 1), n=10 )
plot(g2)
```

when the edge list has vertex names, the number of nodes is not needed  
```{r}
g3 <- graph(edges = c("John", "Jim", "Jim", "Jill", "Jill", "John")) # named vertices  
plot(g3)
```

```{r}
g3
```

```{r}
g4 <- graph( c("John", "Jim", "Jim", "Jack", "Jim", "Jack", "John", "John"), 
             isolates=c("Jesse", "Janis", "Jennifer", "Justin") )

plot(g4, 
     edge.size = 0.5,
     vertex.color = "gold",
     vertex.size = 15,
     vertex.frame.color = "gray",
     vertex.label.color = "black",
     veretex.label.cex = 0.8,
     vertex.label.dist = 2,
     edge.curved = 0.2)
```


```{r}
plot(graph_from_literal(a---b, b---c)) # the number of dashes doesn't matter
```


```{r}
plot(graph_from_literal(a--+b, b+--c))
```

```{r}
plot(graph_from_literal(a+-+b, b+-+c))
```


```{r}
g1 <- graph_from_literal(a-b-c-d-e-f, a-g-h-b, h-e:f:i, j)
plot(g1)
```


## edge, vertex, and network attributes  
access vertices and edges  
```{r}
E(g4)
```

```{r}
V(g4)
```

```{r}
g4[]
```

```{r}
g4[1, ]
```


Add attributes to the network, vertices, or edges  
```{r}
V(g4)$name
```


```{r}
V(g4)$gender <- c("male", "male", "male", "male", "female", "female", "male")
E(g4)$type <- "email"
E(g4)$weight <- 10
```


```{r}
edge_attr(g4)
```

```{r}
vertex_attr(g4)
```


```{r}
graph_attr(g4)
```


Another way to set attributes  
```{r}
g4 <- set_graph_attr(g4, name = "name", value = "Email Network")
g4 <- set_graph_attr(g4, name = "something", value = "a thing")

graph_attr(g4)
```


```{r}
graph_attr(g4, name = "name")
```


```{r}
g4 <- delete_graph_attr(graph = g4, name = "something")
```

```{r}
graph_attr(g4)
```


```{r}
plot(g4,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.5, 
     vertex.label.color = "black",
     vertex.label.dist =1.5,
     vertex.color = c("pink", "skyblue")[1 + (V(g4)$gender == "male")])
```


simplify graph to remove loops and multiple edges between the same nodes  
`edge.attr.comb` possible options: sum, mean, prod, min, max, first, last and ignore.  
`ignore`: the attributes be disregarded and dropped  
```{r}
g4s <- simplify(graph = g4, 
                remove.loops = TRUE,
                remove.multiple = TRUE,
                edge.attr.comb = c(type = "ignore", weight = "sum"))
```

```{r}
plot(g4s,
     vertex.label.dist = 1.5)
```

```{r}
g4s
```

# Reading network data from files  
## Dataset 1 edgelist  
```{r}
nodes <- read.csv(file = "Dataset1-Media-Example-NODES.csv", header = TRUE, as.is = TRUE)
links <- read.csv(file = "Dataset1-Media-Example-EDGES.csv", header = TRUE, as.is = TRUE)

```

```{r}
head(nodes2)
head(links2)
```

```{r}
links2 <- as.matrix(links2)
dim(links2); dim(nodes2)
```


## Turning networks into igraph objects  
```{r}
net <- graph_from_data_frame(d = links, vertices = nodes, directed = TRUE)
class(net)
```

```{r}
net
```

```{r}
E(net)
```

```{r}
V(net)
```


```{r}
E(net)$type
V(net)$media
```

```{r}
edge_attr(net)
print("-------------------------")
vertex_attr(net)
```


```{r}
plot(net,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.4,
     vertex.label = NA)
```

```{r}
net <- simplify(graph = net, 
                remove.loops = TRUE, 
                remove.multiple = F,
                edge.attr.comb = list(weight = "sum", type = "first"))
plot(net, 
     vertex.label = NA,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.5,
     edge.curved = 0,
     layout = layout_with_fr)
```


```{r}
head(nodes2)
head(links2)
```


```{r}
net2 <- graph_from_incidence_matrix(incidence = links2)
table(V(net2)$type)
```

To transform a one-mode network matrix into an igraph object, use instead `graph_from_adjacency_matrix`.   

```{r}
colors <- c("gray50", "tomato", "gold")
V(net)$color <- colors[V(net)$media.type]
edge.start <- ends(net, es = E(net), names = F)[,1]
edge.col <- V(net)$color[edge.start]

plot(net, edge.color = edge.col, edge.curved = 0.1, vertex.label = NA)
```

By default, the coordinates of the plots are rescaled to the [-1,1] interval for both x and y. You can change that with the parameter `rescale=FALSE` and rescale your plot manually by multiplying the coordinates by a scalar.  

You can use `norm_coords` to normalize the plot with the boundaries you want.  

```{r}
net.bg <- sample_pa(n = 80)
V(net.bg)$size <- 8
V(net.bg)$frame.color <- "white"
V(net.bg)$label <- NA
E(net.bg)$arrow.mode <- 0

l <- layout_with_fr(net.bg)
ll <- norm_coords(layout = l, ymin = -1, ymax = 1, xmin = -1, xmax = 1)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(net.bg, rescale = F, layout = ll*0.4)
plot(net.bg, rescale = F, layout = ll*0.6)
plot(net.bg, rescale = F, layout = ll*0.8)
plot(net.bg, rescale = F, layout = ll*1.0)
```



```{r}
layouts <- grep("^layout_", ls("package:igraph"), value = T)[-1]

layouts <- layouts[!grepl("bipartite|merge|norm|sugiyama|tree", layouts)]
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(5, 3), mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1))

for(layout in layouts){
        l <- do.call(layout, list(net))
        plot(net, 
             edge.arrow.mode = 0, 
             layout = l, 
             main = layout,
             vertex.label = NA)
}
```



```{r}
net.m <- net - E(net)[E(net)$type == "hyperlink"]
net.h <- net - E(net)[E(net)$type == "mention"]
```


```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(net.h, vertex.color = "orange", main = "Tie:Hyperlink", vertex.label = NA, rescale = T)
plot(net.m, vertex.color = "orange", main = "Tie:mention", vertex.label = NA, rescale = T)
```



# Network and node descriptives  
### density  
```{r}
edge_density(net, loops = F)
```


```{r}
ecount(net) / (vcount(net)*(vcount(net) - 1))
```

### Reciprocity: the proportion of reciprocated ties (for a directed network)  
```{r}
reciprocity(net)

dyad_census(net) # mutal, asymmetric and null node pairs

2*dyad.census(net)$mut / ecount(net) # for a directed network 
```


### Transitivity  
- global - ratio of triangles (directed disregarded) to connected triples  
- local - ratio of triangles to connected triples each vertex is part of.  
```{r}
transitivity(net, type = "global") # net is treated as an undirected network 
transitivity(as.undirected(net, mode = "collapse")) # same as above
transitivity(net, type = "local")
triad.census(net) # for directed networks  
```

### Diameter   
A network diameter is the longest geodesic distance (length of the shortest path between two nodes) in the network.     

In igraph, `diameter()` returns the distance, while `get_diameter()` returns the nodes along the first found path of that distance.  

Note that edge weights are used by defualt, unless set to NA  
```{r}
diameter(net, directed = F, weights = NA)
```

```{r}
diameter(net, directed = F)
```

```{r}
diam <- get_diameter(net, directed = F) # get the nodes 
```

Note though that when asked to behaved as a vector, a vertex sequence will produce the numeric indexes of the nodes in it. The same applies for edge sequences.  


```{r}
as.vector(diam)
```

```{r}
vcol <- rep("grey40", vcount(net))
vcol[diam] <- "gold"

ecol <- rep("grey80", ecount(net))
ecol[E(net, path = diam, directed = F)] <- "orange"

plot(net, 
     vertex.color = vcol,
     edge.color = ecol,
     edge.arrow.mode = 0,
     vertex.label = NA, 
     vertex.size = V(net)$audience.size, 
     layout = layout_with_lgl,
     rescale = T)
```


### Node degrees  
```{r}
deg <- degree(net, mode = "all")
plot(net, vertex.size = deg*3,
     vertex.label = NA)
```

```{r}
hist(deg, breaks = 1:vcount(net)-1, main = "Histogram of node degree")
```

### degree distribution  
```{r}
deg.dist <- degree_distribution(graph = net, cumulative = TRUE, mode = "all")

plot(x = 0:max(deg), y = 1-deg.dist, pch = 19, cex = 1.2, col = "orange", xlab = "Degree")
```


### Centrality and centralization  
Centrality functions (vertex level) and centralization functions (graph level).  

The centralization functions return res - vertex centrality, centralization, and theoretical_max - maximum centralization score for a graph of that size  

The centrality function can run on a subset of nodes (set with the vids parameter).  

degree: number of ties  
```{r}
degree(net, mode = "in")
```

```{r}
centr_degree(net, mode = "in", normalized = TRUE)
```


Closeness:(centrality based on distance to others in the graph)  
```{r}
closeness(net, mode = "all", weights = NA)
centr_clo(net, mode = "all", normalized = T)
```


Eigenvector: centrality proportional to the sum of connection centralities  
```{r}
eigen_centrality(net, directed = T, weights = NA)
centr_eigen(net, directed = T, normalized = T)
```



Betweenness: centrality based on a broker position connecting others  
```{r}
betweenness(net, directed = T, weights = NA)
edge_betweenness(net, directed = T, weights = NA)
centr_betw(net, directed = T, normalized = T)
```


### Hubs and authorities  
Hubs were expected to contain catalogs with a large number of outgoing links; while authorities would get many incoming links from hubs, presumably because of their high-quality relevant information.  

```{r}
hs <- hub_score(net, weights = NA)$vector
as <- authority_score(net, weights = NA)$vector
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(net, 
     vertex.size = hs*50, 
     main = "Hubs",
     vertex.label = NA,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.5)
plot(net, 
     vertex.size = as*50, 
     main = "Authorities",
     vertex.label = NA,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.5)
```


### Distances and paths  
Average path length: the mean of the shortest distance between each pair of nodes in the network (in both directions for directed graphs).  

```{r}
mean_distance(net, directed = F)
```

```{r}
mean_distance(net, directed = T)
```

find all shortest paths in the graph  
```{r}
distances(net) # with edge weights
distances(net, weights = NA) # ignore weights
```

get the distance of every media from the New York Times  
```{r}
dist.from.NYT <- distances(graph = net, v = V(net)[media == "NY Times"], to = V(net), weights = NA)
```

```{r}
oranges <- colorRampPalette(colors = c("dark red", "gold"))
col <- oranges(max(dist.from.NYT)+1)
col <- col[dist.from.NYT + 1]
```

```{r}
plot(net,
     vertex.color = col,
     vertex.label = dist.from.NYT,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.6,
     vertex.label.color = "white")
```


find shortest path between specific nodes  
```{r}
news.path <- shortest_paths(graph = net,
                            from = V(net)[media == "MSNBC"],
                            to = V(net)[media == "New York Post"],
                            output = "both")


```

```{r}
ecol <- rep("gray80", ecount(net))
ecol[unlist(news.path$epath)] <- "orange"

ew <- rep(2, ecount(net))
ew[unlist(news.path$epath)] <- 4


vcol <- rep("gray40", vcount(net))
vcol[unlist(news.path$vpath)] <- "gold"

vlab <- V(net)$media
vlab[setdiff(x = 1:vcount(net), y = unlist(news.path$vpath))] <- NA

plot(net,
     vertex.color = vcol,
     edge.color = ecol,
     edge.width = ew,
     edge.arrow.mode = 0,
     vertex.label = vlab,
     vertex.label.cex = 0.7,
     vertex.label.color = "blue")
```


Identify the edges going into or out of a vertex, for instance the WSJ. For a single node, use `incident()`, for multiple nodes use `incident_edges()`.  

```{r}
inc.edges <- incident(graph = net, 
                      v = V(net)[media == "Wall Street Journal"], 
                      mode = "all")

ecol <- rep("gray80", ecount(net))
ecol[unlist(inc.edges)] <- "orange"
```

```{r}
vcol <- rep("gray40", vcount(net))
vcol[V(net)$media == "Wall Street Journal"] <- "gold"

plot(net, 
     vertex.color = vcol, 
     edge.color = ecol, 
     edge.arrow.size = 0.5,
     vertex.label = NA)
```

find immediate neighbors of a vertex  

`neighbors()` finds all nodes one step out from the focal actor.  
```{r}
neigh.nodes <- neighbors(graph = net, v = V(net)[media == "Wall Street Journal"], mode = "out")

vcol <- rep("gray40", vcount(net))
vcol[neigh.nodes] <- "tomato"
vcol[V(net)$media  == "Wall Street Journal"] <- "orange"
vlab <- V(net)$media
vlab[setdiff(x = 1:vcount(net), y = unlist(neigh.nodes))] <- NA

plot(net, 
     vertex.color = vcol,
     vertex.label = vlab,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.5,
     vertex.label.cex = 0.7)
```

To find the neighbors for multiple nodes, use adjacent_vertices() instead of neighbors().  

To find node neighborhoods going more than one step out, use function ego() with parameter order set to the number of steps out to go from the focal node(s).  

Special operators for the indexing of edge sequences: %-%, %->%, %<-%  
```
E(network)[X %-% Y]: selects edges between vertex sets X and Y, ignoring direction  

E(network)[X %->% Y]: selects edges from vertex sets X to vertex set Y  

E(network)[X %<-% Y]: selects edges from vertex sets Y to vertex set X  
```

example: select edges from newspapers to online sources:  
```{r}
E(net)[V(net)[type.label == "Newspaper"] %->% V(net)[type.label == "Online"]]
```
