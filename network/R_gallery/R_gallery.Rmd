## Adjacency matrix  
An adjacency matrix is a square matrix where individuals in rows and columns are the same.  

It's typically the kind of matrix you get when calculating the correlation between each pair of individual. By default, we get an unweighted and oriented network.

```{r}
library(igraph)
set.seed(10)
```


```{r}
data <- matrix(sample(x = 0:2, size = 25, replace = T), nrow = 5)
rownames(data) <- LETTERS[1:5];colnames(data) <- LETTERS[1:5]
```

```{r}
network <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(data)
plot(network)
```
