[from this site](https://www.financialwisdomforum.org/gummy-stuff/Yahoo-data.htm)

Here's a neat way to download stock data from Yahoo, perhaps into a spreadsheet (so you can play with the data):
http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s= a BUNCH of STOCK SYMBOLS separated by "+" &f=a bunch of special tags
for example: http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=XOM+BBDb.TO+JNJ+MSFT&f=snd1l1yr


```{r}
download.file(url = "http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=XOM+BBDb.TO+JNJ+MSFT&f=snd1l1yr", 
              destfile = "fin.csv")
```
