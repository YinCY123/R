# Links between inflammation and cancer  
## the evidence that links cancer and inflammation  
+ inflammatory diseases increase the risk of developing many types of cancer.  
+ non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce the risk of developing certain cancers and reduce the mortality caused by these cancers.  
+ Signalling pathways involved in inflammation operate downstream of oncogenic mutations.  
+ Inflammatory cells, chemokines and cytokines are present in the microenivironment of all tumors in experimental animal models and humans from the earliest of development.  
+ The targeting of inflammatory mediators, key transcription factors involved in inflammation or inflammatory cells decreases the incidence and spread of cancer.  
+ Adoptive transfer of inflammatory cells or overexpression of inflammatory cytokines promotes the development of tumors.  


## pro-tumor inflammation
1. This papaer[@Balkwill2001] identified the links between inflammation and cancer, on the basis of observations that tumors often arose at sites of chronic inflammation and that inflammatory cells were present in biopsied samples from tumours.    

2. The activation of RET (protein tyrosine kinase) induces a transcriptional program that is similar to that which occurs during inflammation[@Borrello2005;@DeFalco2007].  

3. Tumor-associated inflammation might caused by abnormal release and local accumulation of "irritating" tumor products[@Mantovani1992].

4. for many neoplasms, specific immunity is not a major determinant of macrophage infiltration and that factors derived from the tumor itself play a pivotal role in the regulation of macrophage levels in poorly immunogenic metasatatic tumors. This consideration led to search for tumor-derived chemotactic factors released by neoplastic lines:

**Cytokine**|**Role**
--|--|--
Monocyte chemotactic protein 1(**MCP-1**)|Recruitment via chemotaxis; systemic anti-inflammation
Monocyte colony-stimulating factor(**M-CSF**)|Promotion of survival,proliferation,chemotaxis,downregulation of oxidative burst
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor(**GM-CSF**)|Recruitment via interaction with endothelium and chemotaxis;inhibition of cytotoxicity
Vascular permeability factor(**VPF**)|Recruitment via chemotaxis, angiogenesis, leakiness of tumor vasculature
Inhibitors|Downregulation of recruitment and activation;and activation;systemic anti-inflammation

## anti-tumor inflammation  
1. In certain tumors or subsets of tumors the presence of inflammatory cells is associated with better prognosis [@Mantovani1992;@Nickoloff2005].  
2. Evidence indicates that NF-kB is important in determining this balance between the protumor and antitumor properties of macrophage[@Saccani2006;@Hagemann2008].  
3. re-educate tumor-promoting macrophage from protumor to antimor phenotype[@Hagemann2008].  
4. In a skin model, the overexpression of NF-kB was found to inhibit invasive epidermal neoplasia[@], wherease blocking NF-kB activity inhibited the development of experimental liver and colon cancers[@Dajee2003;@Pikarsky2004].
5. some patients with cancer who had servere postoperative infections at the tumor site underwent spontaneous and sustained tumor regressions[@Mantovani2008].

# Unanswered questions about cancer-related inflammation  
1. is inflammation sufficient for cancer development?  
    + Several lines of evidence provide hints that is can. In a muse model of bowel inflammation caused by IL-10 deficiency, the frequency of DNA mutations observed in the colon in the absence of exogenous carcinogens was 4-5 fold greater than in IL-10-sufficient mice[@Sato2006].  
    
2. despite diversity of tumors and oncogenic pathways, are there aspects of cancer-related inflammation that are common to all malignancies?  
3. How can the balance between 'bad' inflammation and 'good' inflammation be altered to favor adative immunity instead of tumor development?  
4. What is the relationship between MDSCs and TAMs?  
5. What is the clinical relevance of the connections between sex steroid hormones and inflammation?  
6. What is the best way to target cancer-related inflammation in patients with cancer? This is the most difficult question.  
7. It will be important to define which cellular and molecular components are common to all cancer-promoting inflammatory responses, and which are specific to particular tissue and tumor types.  
8. The definition of MDSCs is operational and includes a heterogeneous set of cells in the peripheral blood and spleen. Are these cells a distinct population, or do they belong to a continuum of TAM differentiation?  


# Origin of tumor-associated macrophages  
1. In 1863, Virchow first identified host leukocytes in and/or at the edge of tumor tissue[@Mantovani1992].  
2. In 1907, Hardley reported that normal cell infiltration in malignant melanoma indicates a "regressive process"[@Mantovani1992]. 
3. TAM can express peculiar membrane antigens and high levels of MHCII molecules. This class II expression is lost on culture, a loss reversed by gamma-interferon (IFN-g), suggesting reversible induction in the tumor micronenvironment[@Mantovani1992].  
4. monocyte-macrophage are potent productors of proteinases which might contribute to tissue invasion of tumor cells[@Mantovani1992].  
5. administration of macrophage specific toxins augments metastasis in various tumor models by affecting early steps of implantation and growth of secondary foci[@Mantovani1992].  
6. transplantation of tumor cells mixed with macrophages in normal or monocytopenic hosts results in the earlier appearance or faster growth of various murine tumors[@Mantovani1992].  


# TAM re-education
1. macrophages are polarized via interleukin (IL)-1R and MyD88 to an immuno-suppressive "alternative" phenotype that requires IkB kinase b-mediated NK-kB activation [@Hagemann2008].  
2. When NF-kB signaling is inhibited specifically in TAMs, they become cytotoxic to tumor cells and switch to a "classically" activated phenotype: IL-12^high^, major histocompatibility complex II^high^, but IL-10^low^ and arginase-1^low^[@Hagemann2008].  
3. Mouse models of colon and liver cancer have defined an important role for NF-kB activation in driving cancer-associated inflammation[@Mantovani2004;@Pikarsky2004].  
4. malignant epithelial cells drive NF-kB activation in TAMs in a way that maintains their immuno-suppressive phenotype[@Hagemann2008].
5. Co-culture with macrophage deficient in MyD88 and IL-1R but not Toll-like recepptor (TLR)2 or TLR4 inhibited invasiveness of tumor cell in vitro[@Hagemann2008].  

# Characteristics of M1 and M2 macropahge
1. Classically activated macrophages (M1) and "alternatively" activated macrophages (M2) represent two extremes in the spectrum of the macropahge phenotype[@Gordon2010].  
2. M2 macrophages produce high amounts of IL-10 but not IL-12, express scavenger receptors, and exhibit anti-inflammatory and tissue repair functions[@Mantovani2004].  
3. M1 macrophages activated by microbial products or IFN-g, produce large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, and are potent killers of pathogens and tumor cells[@Gordon2010].
