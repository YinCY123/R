## Macrophage and bacterial control  
- Is there penetration of macrophages into the lining of epithelial cells? Does this penetration prevail by one population of macrophages?  

- Are there macrophages sampling bacteria across epithelial monolayer? ( Inject E.coli and collect urine and test macrophage number and the bacterail-swallowing  macrophages.)  

- Measure phagocytosis of macrophages of labeled E.coli in kidney.(*To support both (2) and (3) Confocal microscopy monitoring of E.coli take-up by macrophages in live kidney slides.)  

- After CCR2 blocker or using iDTR model to deplete monocyte-derived macrophage or the self-mainaining macrophages, respectively, measure the severity of E.coli infection.  

- Making OVA-expressing E.coli and test what cells presenting OVA antigens.
