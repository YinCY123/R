# RNAi  
For in vitro knock-down Pdgfra/b, reference mRNA sequence NM_001083316.2 and NM_001146268.1 were used respectively, four candidate sites were choosed for each gene by using WI siRNA Selection Program (http://sirna.wi.mit.edu/home.php), and control siRNA was generated by using the nucleotides frequency of the four candidate sites. Oligo ordered from Sango Biotech, annealed oligo were inserted between BglII and HindIII on the vector system, pSUPER.neo-GFP, created by [@Brummelkamp2002], 9 nucleotides size loop was obeyed to [@Brummelkamp2002], as it has the highest activity.
