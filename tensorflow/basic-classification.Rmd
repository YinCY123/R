Build the model  
building the neural network requires configuring the layers of the model, then compiling the model.  

the basic building block of a neural network is the layer. layers extract representations from the data fed into them. and hopefully, these representations are more meaningful for the problem at hand.  

Most of deep learning consists of chaining together simple layers. most layers, like `layer_dense` have parameters that are during training.  
```{r setup the layers}
model <- keras_model_sequential()

model %>% layer_flatten(input_shape = c(28, 28)) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = "relu") %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = "softmax")
```

- the `layer_flattern` transform 2d-array to 1d-array  

compile the model  
```{r}
model %>% 
  compile(
    optimizer = "adam",
    loss = "sparse_categorical_crossentropy",
    metrics = c("accuracy")
  )
```


train the model  
```{r}
model %>% fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs = 5)
```

evaluate accuracy  
```{r}
score <- model %>% evaluate(test_image, test_labels)
cat("Test loss:", score$loss, "\n")
cat("Test accuracy: ", score$accuracy, "\n")
```
It turns out, the accuracy on the test dataset is a little less than the accuracy on the training dataset.  

This gap between training accuracy and test accuracy is an example of overfitting. Overfitting is when a machine learning model performs worse on new data than on their training data.  

make predictions 
```{r}
prediction <- model %>% predict(test_image)
prediction[1, ]
```
