abstract = {Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy has revolutionized the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This review will summarize the current evidence of anti-VEGF therapy in neovascular AMD, including subtypes of retinal angiomatous proliferation and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Importantly, 2 large multicenter randomized clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of anti-VEGF monotherapy and combination with photodynamic therapy (PDT) have recently reported initial first-year outcomes. In this review, we summarize the latest updates in the efficacy and safety of anti-VEGF monotherapy and combination with PDT in common lesion subtypes. Remaining gaps in current understanding are highlighted where further research is needed.},

In order to survive the constant onslaught of phage, bacteria have evolved mechanistically diverse defense strategies that act at every stage of the phage life cycle (Fig 1)[4,5]. Phages rapidly co-evolve to overcome these barriers, resulting in a constant, and often surprising, molecular arms race [6]. In this review, I highlight the spectrum of “innate” strategies used by bacteria to evade phage predation, with particular attention paid to more recent findings in the field. For a discussion of the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune system, readers are directed to several recent reviews [4–6].},

abstract = {Summary Small proteins are traditionally overlooked due to computational and experimental difficulties in detecting them. To systematically identify small proteins, we carried out a comparative genomics study on 1,773 human-associated metagenomes from four different body sites. We describe {\textgreater}4,000 conserved protein families, the majority of which are novel; ∼30{\%} of these protein families are predicted to be secreted or transmembrane. Over 90{\%} of the small protein families have no known domain and almost half are not represented in reference genomes. We identify putative housekeeping, mammalian-specific, defense-related, and protein families that are likely to be horizontally transferred. We provide evidence of transcription and translation for a subset of these families. Our study suggests that small proteins are highly abundant and those of the human microbiome, in particular, may perform diverse functions that have not been previously reported.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry proteomics typically relies upon analyzing outcomes of single analyses; however, comparing raw data across multiple experiments should enhance both peptide/protein identification and quantitation. In the absence of convincing tandem MS identifications, comparing peptide quantities between experiments (or fractions) requires the chromatographic alignment of MS signals. An extension of dynamic time warping (DTW), termed ordered bijective interpolated warping (OBI-Warp), is presented and used to align a variety of electrospray ionization liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (ESI-LC-MS) proteomics data sets. An algorithm to produce a bijective (one-to-one) function from DTW output is coupled with piecewise cubic hermite interpolation to produce a smooth warping function. Data sets were chosen to represent a broad selection of ESI-LC-MS alignment cases. High confidence, overlapping tandem mass spectra are used as standards to optimize and compare alignment parameters. We determine that Pearson's correlation coefficient as a measure of spectra similarity outperforms covariance, dot product, and Euclidean distance in its ability to produce correct alignments with optimal and suboptimal alignment parameters. We demonstrate the importance of penalizing gaps for best alignments. Using optimized parameters, we show that OBI-Warp produces alignments consistent with time standards across these data sets.

abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing can reveal the transcriptional state of cells, yet provides little insight into the upstream regulatory landscape associated with open or accessible chromatin regions. Joint profiling of accessible chromatin and RNA within the same cells would permit direct matching of transcriptional regulation to its outputs. Here, we describe droplet-based single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and mRNA expression sequencing (SNARE-seq), a method that can link a cell's transcriptome with its accessible chromatin for sequencing at scale. Specifically, accessible sites are captured by Tn5 transposase in permeabilized nuclei to permit, within many droplets in parallel, DNA barcode tagging together with the mRNA molecules from the same cells. To demonstrate the utility of SNARE-seq, we generated joint profiles of 5,081 and 10,309 cells from neonatal and adult mouse cerebral cortices, respectively. We reconstructed the transcriptome and epigenetic landscapes of major and rare cell types, uncovered lineage-specific accessible sites, especially for low-abundance cells, and connected the dynamics of promoter accessibility with transcription level during neurogenesis.},

abstract = {Improved analytical technologies and data extraction algorithms enable detection of {\textgreater}10 000 reproducible signals by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry, creating a bottleneck in chemical identification. In principle, measurement of more than one million chemicals would be possible if algorithms were available to facilitate utilization of the raw mass spectrometry data, especially low-abundance metabolites. Here we describe an automated computational framework to annotate ions for possible chemical identity using a multistage clustering algorithm in which metabolic pathway associations are used along with intensity profiles, retention time characteristics, mass defect, and isotope/adduct patterns. The algorithm uses high-resolution mass spectrometry data for a series of samples with common properties and publicly available chemical, metabolic, and environmental databases to assign confidence levels to annotation results. Evaluation results show that the algorithm achieves an F1-measure of 0.8 for a data set with known targets and is more robust than previously reported results for cases when database size is much greater than the actual number of metabolites. MS/MS evaluation of a set of randomly selected 210 metabolites annotated using xMSannotator in an untargeted metabolomics human data set shows that 80{\%} of features with high or medium confidence scores have ion dissociation patterns consistent with the xMSannotator annotation. The algorithm has been incorporated into an R package, xMSannotator, which includes utilities for querying local or online databases such as ChemSpider, KEGG, HMDB, T3DB, and LipidMaps.},

Previous studies of native or engineered sequences have remained limited in scale. Here, we use random sequences as an alternative, allowing us to measure the expression output of over 100 million synthetic yeast promoters. Random sequences yield a broad range of reproducible expression levels, indicating that the fortuitous binding sites in random DNA are functional. From these data we learn models of transcriptional regulation that predict over 94{\%} of the expression driven from independent test data and nearly 89{\%} from sequences from yeast promoters. These models allow us to characterize the activity of TFs and their interactions with chromatin, and help refine cis -regulatory motifs. We find that strand, position, and helical face preferences of TFs are widespread and depend on interactions with neighboring chromatin. Such massive-throughput regulatory assays of random DNA provide the diverse examples necessary to learn complex models of cis -regulatory logic.},

@article{Olivon2017,
abstract = {Molecular networking is becoming more and more popular into the metabolomic community to organize tandem mass spectrometry (MS 2) data. Even though this approach allows the treatment and comparison of large data sets, several drawbacks related to the MS-Cluster tool routinely used on the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking platform (GNPS) limit its potential. MS-Cluster cannot distinguish between chromatography well-resolved isomers as retention times are not taken into account. Annotation with predicted chemical formulas is also not implemented and semiquantification is only based on the number of MS 2 scans. We propose to introduce a data-preprocessing workflow including the preliminary data treatment by MZmine 2 followed by a homemade Python script freely available to the community that clears the major previously mentioned GNPS drawbacks. The efficiency of this workflow is exemplified with the analysis of six fractions of increasing polarities obtained from a sequential supercritical CO 2 extraction of Stillingia lineata leaves. A mong the several mass spectrometry based metabolomics workflows recently developed, 1,2 Molecular Networking (MN) has appeared as a promising approach to dereplicate complex natural product mixtures. 3 This tool is becoming a standard for metabolomics analysis and gathers together a community of nearly 10000 users from 100 countries. MN significantly facilitates the tandem mass spectrometry (MS 2) data classification by organizing spectra sharing homologous fragmentations into a user-friendly visual representation. Assuming that similar molecules share similar fragmentation patterns, structurally related compounds are prone to cluster together within a network. Unlike many other dereplication strategies, MN has the unique advantage to identify known compounds through the integration of authentic standards or comparison with spectral libraries, but also to target unknown analogues more efficiently. Thus, standard MS 2 data act as "structural landmarks", enabling the annotation of related clusters of spectra. Despite valuable outputs, some improvements are still required to generate unambiguous molecular networks. Initially developed for proteomics purposes, the MS-Cluster algorithm implemented on the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking platform (GNPS) platform was developed for the identification of redundant spectra from a same peptide and their replacement with a single averaged spectrum. 4 Based on the premise that occurrence of truly isobaric peptides eluting at different retention times (RTs) in liquid chromatography (LC) is rather uncommon in proteomics, MS-Cluster developers did not integrate RT information for restricted clustering over limited RT ranges. However, in metabolomics samples, the separation of isomers is common. By activating the MS-Cluster option, groups of isomers will ineluctably gather together within the same nodes leading to merge MS 2 data unexpectedly. Furthermore, GNPS quantification system simply relies on the number of MS 2 spectra detected for each precursor ion. This method is highly dependent on the data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode parameters (number of precursor ions per scan, ion intensity threshold, exclusion rules). Thus, GNPS quantification only leads to a rough approximation of relative or absolute abundances. Finally, annotation of molecular networks by molecular formula generated from any commercial or freely available algorithm is not currently implemented. In the meantime, to face the increasing amount of data generated by untargeted LC-MS analyses of complex mixtures, numerous free software suites, such as XCMS, 5 MetaboAna-lyst, 6 OpenMS, 7 MaxQuant, 8 or SMART, 9 have been developed. These programs include sophisticated computational pipelines that typically consist of peak picking, integration, linear or nonlinear alignment, and normalization steps in order to extract meaningful information. Among them, MZmine 2 is one of the most popular and user-friendly software packages for metabolomics. 10 Its motivation is to propose straightforward operations for nonexpert users and a flexible and modular platform for MS data processing.},

Although Argonaute proteins are conserved in all life forms from bacteria to eukaryotes, until now studies have focused on the biological functions of eukaryotic Argonautes. Here we highlight two recent studies that discover the functions of prokaryotic Argonautes in defence against exogenous DNA. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Natural products (NPs) research is changing and rapidly adopting cutting-edge tools, which radically transform the way to characterize extracts and small molecules. With the innovations in metabolomics, early integration of deep metabolome annotation information allows to efficiently guide the isolation of valuable NPs only and, in parallel, to generate massive metadata sets for the study of given extracts under various perspectives. This is the case for chemotaxonomy studies where common biosynthetic traits among species can be evidenced, but also for drug discovery purpose where such traits, in combination with bioactivity studies on extracts, may evidence bioactive molecules even before their isolation. One of the major bottlenecks of such studies remains the level of accuracy at which NPs can be identified. We discuss here the advancements in LC–MS and associated mining methods by addressing what would be ideal and what is achieved today. We propose future developments for reinforcing generic NPs databases both in the spectral and structural dimensions by heading towards a virtuous metabolite identification cycle allowing annotation of both known and unreported metabolites in an iterative manner. Such approaches could significantly accelerate and improve our knowledge of the huge chemodiversity found in nature.},

abstract = {The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 2 (ICAM-2) in adult tissues is restricted to vascular endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. We have previously shown that the endothelial-specific in vivo activity of the human ICAM-2 promoter is contained within a small (0.33-kilobase (kbp)) 5'- flanking region of the gene. Here we describe the in vitro characterization of this region. The ICAM-2 promoter is TATA-less, and transcription in endothelial cells initiates at four sites. Reporter gene expression directed by the promoter was 125-fold greater than vector alone in bovine aortic endothelial cells but less than 2-fold vector alone in non-endothelial (COS) cells, confirming that specificity in vivo was paralleled in vitro. The addition of 2.7 kbp of 5'-flanking region to the 0.33-kbp fragment had no effect on promoter activity or specificity. The mutation of an Sp1 motif centered at base pair -194 or an eight-base pair palindrome at -268 each reduced promoter activity by 70{\%}. Mutation of GATA motifs at -145 and -53 reduced promoter activity by 78 and 61{\%}, respectively. Specific binding of bovine aortic endothelial cells nuclear proteins to the Sp1 and GATA sites was demonstrated by gel shift analysis. Promoter activity in COS cells was transactivated 3-4-fold by overexpression of GATA-2. The results presented here suggest that transcription from the ICAM-2 promoter in endothelial cells is regulated by the interplay of several positive-acting factors and provide the basis for further analysis of endothelial-specific gene expression.},

We highlight four different regulatory processes: alternative transcription initiation, alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, and alternative translation initiation. We discuss their transcriptome-wide distribution, their impact on protein expression, their biological relevance, and the possible molecular mechanisms leading to their alternative regulation. We conclude with a discussion of the coordination and the interdependence of these four regulatory layers.},

abstract = {The early stages of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are characterized by the accumulation of basal laminar deposits (BLamDs). The mechanism for BLamDs accumulating between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and its basal lamina remains elusive. Here we examined the role in AMD of lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP2), a glycoprotein that plays a critical role in lysosomal biogenesis and maturation of autophagosomes/ phagosomes. LAMP2 was preferentially expressed by RPE cells, and its expression declined with age. Deletion of the Lamp2 gene in mice resulted in age-dependent autofluorescence abnormalities of the fundus, thickening of Bruch's membrane, and the formation of BLamDs, resembling histopathological changes occurring in AMD. Moreover, LAMP2-deficient mice developed molecular signatures similar to those found in human AMD—namely, the accumulation of APOE, APOA1, clusterin, and vitronectin—adjacent to BLamDs. In contrast, collagen 4, laminin, and fibronectin, which are extracellular matrix proteins constituting RPE basal lamina and Bruch's membrane were reduced in Lamp2 knockout (KO) mice. Mechanistically, retarded phagocytic degradation of photoreceptor outer segments compromised lysosomal degradation and increased exocytosis in LAMP2-deficient RPE cells. The accumulation of BLamDs observed in LAMP2-deficient mice was eventually followed by loss of the RPE and photoreceptors. Finally, we observed loss of LAMP2 expression along with ultramicroscopic features of abnormal phagocytosis and exocytosis in eyes from AMD patients but not from control individuals. Taken together, these results indicate an important role for LAMP2 in RPE function in health and disease, suggesting that LAMP2 reduction may contribute to the formation of BLamDs in AMD.},

abstract = {Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data from sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads) extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the optimal location. When the read length is {\textless}160 bp, overlapping subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is sensitive because no individual subread is required to map exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It scales up efficiently for longer reads.},

Existing strategies for reducing genome-wide off-target effects of the widely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) are imperfect, possessing only partial or unproven efficacies and other limitations that constrain their use. Here we describe SpCas9-HF1, a high-fidelity variant harbouring alterations designed to reduce non-specific DNA contacts. SpCas9-HF1 retains on-target activities comparable to wild-type SpCas9 with {\textgreater}85{\%} of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) tested in human cells. Notably, with sgRNAs targeted to standard non-repetitive sequences, SpCas9-HF1 rendered all or nearly all off-target events undetectable by genome-wide break capture and targeted sequencing methods. Even for atypical, repetitive target sites, the vast majority of off-target mutations induced by wild-type SpCas9 were not detected with SpCas9-HF1. With its exceptional precision, SpCas9-HF1 provides an alternative to wild-type SpCas9 for research and therapeutic applications. More broadly, our results suggest a general strategy for optimizing genome-wide specificities of other CRISPR-RNA-guided nucleases.},

abstract = {Untargeted analysis performed using full-scan mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with liquid chromatography (LC) is commonly used in metabolomics. Although they are commonly employed, full-scan MS methods such as quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS have been restricted by various factors including their limited linear range and complicated data processing. LC coupled with triple quadrupole (QQQ) MS operated in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode is the gold standard for metabolite quantification; however, only known metabolites are generally quantified, limiting its applications in metabolomic analysis. In this study, a pseudotargeted approach was proposed to perform serum metabolomic analysis using an ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)/QQQ MS system operated in the MRM mode, for which the MRM ion pairs were acquired from the serum samples through untargeted tandem MS using UHPLC/Q-TOF MS. The UHPLC/QQQ MRM MS-based pseudotargeted method displayed better repeatability and wider linear range than the traditional UHPLC/Q-TOF MS-based untargeted metabolomics method, and no complicated peak alignment was required. The developed method was applied to discover serum biomarkers for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with HCC had decreased lysophosphatidylcholine, increased long-chain and decreased medium-chain acylcarnitines, and increased aromatic and decreased branched-chain amino acid levels compared to healthy controls. The novelty of this work is that it provides an approach to acquire MRM ion pairs from real samples, is not limited to metabolite standards, and it provides a foundation to achieve pseudotargeted metabolomic analysis on the widely used LC/QQQ MS platform.},

abstract = {XCMS Online (xcmsonline.scripps.edu) is a cloud-based informatic platform designed to process and visualize mass-spectrometry-based, untargeted metabolomic data. Initially, the platform was developed for two-group comparisons to match the independent, "control" versus "disease" experimental design. Here, we introduce an enhanced XCMS Online interface that enables users to perform dependent (paired) two-group comparisons, meta-analysis, and multigroup comparisons, with comprehensive statistical output and interactive visualization tools. Newly incorporated statistical tests cover a wide array of trnivariate analyses. Multigroup comparison allows for the identification of differentially expressed metabolite features across multiple classes of data while higher order meta-analysis facilitates the identification of shared metabolic patterns across multiple two-group comparisons. Given the complexity of these data sets, we have developed an interactive platform where users can monitor the statistical output of univariate (cloud plots) and multivariate (PCA plots) data analysis in real time by adjusting the threshold and range of various parameters. On the interactive cloud plot, metabolite features can be filtered out by their significance level (p-value), fold change, mass-to-charge ratio, retention time, and intensity. The variation pattern of each feature can be visualized on both extracted-ion chromatograms and box plots. The interactive principal component analysis includes scores, loadings, and scree plots that can be adjusted depending on scaling criteria. The utility of XCMS fiinctionalities is demonstrated through the metabolomic analysis of bacterial stress response and the comparison of lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines.},

Typical metabolomic experiments can therefore produce large amounts of data. Handling such complex datasets is an important step that has big impact on extent and quality at which the metabolite identification and quantification can be made, and thus on the ultimate biological interpretation of results. Increasing interest in metabolomics thus led to resurgence of interest in related data processing. A wide variety of methods and software tools have been developed for metabolomics during recent years, and this trend is likely to continue. In this paper we overview the key steps of metabolomic data processing and focus on reviewing recent literature related to this topic, particularly on methods for handling data from liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) experiments. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The confidence in MS/MS-based annotation of chemical structures is impacted by instrumental settings and requirements, data acquisition modes including data-dependent and data-independent methods, library scoring algorithms, as well as post-curation steps. We critically discuss parameters that influence search results, such as mass accuracy, precursor ion isolation width, intensity thresholds, centroiding algorithms, and acquisition speed. A range of publicly and commercially available MS/MS databases such as NIST, MassBank, MoNA, LipidBlast, Wiley MSforID, and METLIN are surveyed. In addition, software tools including NIST MS Search, MS-DIAL, Mass Frontier, SmileMS, Mass++, and XCMS2 to perform fast MS/MS search are discussed. MS/MS scoring algorithms and challenges during compound annotation are reviewed. Advanced methods such as the in silico generation of tandem mass spectra using quantum chemistry and machine learning methods are covered. Community efforts for curation and sharing of tandem mass spectra that will allow for faster distribution of scientific discoveries are discussed.},

abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a devastating disease-causing vision loss in millions of people around the world. In advanced stages of disease, death of photoreceptor cells, retinal pigment epithelial cells, and choroidal endothelial cells (CECs) are common. Loss of endothelial cells of the choriocapillaris is one of the earliest detectable events in AMD, and, because the outer retina relies on the choriocapillaris for metabolic support, this loss may be the trigger for progression to more advanced stages. Here we highlight evidence for loss of CECs, including changes to vascular density within the choriocapillaris, altered abundance of CEC markers, and changes to overall thickness of the choroid. Furthermore, we review the key components and functions of the choroid, as well as Bruch's membrane, both of which are vital for healthy vision. We discuss changes to the structure and molecular composition of these tissues, many of which develop with age and may contribute to AMD pathogenesis. For example, a crucial event that occurs in the aging choriocapillaris is accumulation of the membrane attack complex, which may result in complement-mediated CEC lysis, and may be a primary cause for AMD-Associated choriocapillaris degeneration. The actions of elevated monomeric C-reactive protein in the choriocapillaris in at-risk individuals may also contribute to the inflammatory environment in the choroid and promote disease progression. Finally, we discuss the progress that has been made in the development of AMD therapies, with a focus on cell replacement.},

abstract = {DNA–calcium phosphate co-precipitates arise spontaneously in supersaturated solutions. Highly effective precipitates for transfection purposes, however, can be generated only in a very narrow range of physico-chemical conditions that control the initiation and growth of precipitate complexes. The concentrations of calcium and phosphate are the main factors influencing characteristics of the precipitate complex, but other parameters, such as temperature, DNA concentration and reaction time are important as well. An example for this is the finding that almost all of the soluble DNA in the reaction mix can be bound into an insoluble complex with calcium phosphate in {\textless}1 min. Extending the reaction time to 20 min results in aggregation and/or growth of particles and reduces the level of expression. With improved protocols we gained better reproducibility and higher efficiencies both for transient and for stable transfections. Up to 60{\%} of cells stained positive for $\beta$-gal and transient production of secreted proteins was improved 5- to 10-fold over results seen with transfections using standard procedures. Similar improvements in efficiency (number of recombinant cell colonies) were observed with stable transfections, using co-transfected marker plasmids for selection. Transient expression levels 2 days after DNA transfer and titers obtained from stable cell lines, emerging weeks later, showed strong correlation.},

abstract = {Electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) is commonly used in high throughput metabolomics. One of the key obstacles to the effective use of this technology is the difficulty in interpreting measured spectra to accurately and efficiently identify metabolites. Traditional methods for automated metabolite identification compare the target MS or MS/MS spectrum to the spectra in a reference database, ranking candidates based on the closeness of the match. However the limited coverage of available databases has led to an interest in computational methods for predicting reference MS/MS spectra from chemical structures. This work proposes a probabilistic generative model for the MS/MS fragmentation process, which we call Competitive Fragmentation Modeling (CFM), and a machine learning approach for learning parameters for this model from MS/MS data. We show that CFM can be used in both a MS/MS spectrum prediction task (ie, predicting the mass spectrum from a chemical structure), and in a putative metabolite identification task (ranking possible structures for a target MS/MS spectrum). In the MS/MS spectrum prediction task, CFM shows significantly improved performance when compared to a full enumeration of all peaks corresponding to substructures of the molecule. In the metabolite identification task, CFM obtains substantially better rankings for the correct candidate than existing methods (MetFrag and FingerID) on tripeptide and metabolite data, when querying PubChem or KEGG for candidate structures of similar mass.},

@article{Nickla2010,
abstract = {The choroid of the eye is primarily a vascular structure supplying the outer retina. It has several unusual features: It contains large membrane-lined lacunae, which, at least in birds, function as part of the lymphatic drainage of the eye and which can change their volume dramatically, thereby changing the thickness of the choroid as much as four-fold over a few days (much less in primates). It contains non-vascular smooth muscle cells, especially behind the fovea, the contraction of which may thin the choroid, thereby opposing the thickening caused by expansion of the lacunae. It has intrinsic choroidal neurons, also mostly behind the central retina, which may control these muscles and may modulate choroidal blood flow as well. These neurons receive sympathetic, parasympathetic and nitrergic innervation. The choroid has several functions: Its vasculature is the major supply for the outer retina; impairment of the flow of oxygen from choroid to retina may cause Age-Related Macular Degeneration. The choroidal blood flow, which is as great as in any other organ, may also cool and warm the retina. In addition to its vascular functions, the choroid contains secretory cells, probably involved in modulation of vascularization and in growth of the sclera. Finally, the dramatic changes in choroidal thickness move the retina forward and back, bringing the photoreceptors into the plane of focus, a function demonstrated by the thinning of the choroid that occurs when the focal plane is moved back by the wearing of negative lenses, and, conversely, by the thickening that occurs when positive lenses are worn. In addition to focusing the eye, more slowly than accommodation and more quickly than emmetropization, we argue that the choroidal thickness changes also are correlated with changes in the growth of the sclera, and hence of the eye. Because transient increases in choroidal thickness are followed by a prolonged decrease in synthesis of extracellular matrix molecules and a slowing of ocular elongation, and attempts to decouple the choroidal and scleral changes have largely failed, it seems that the thickening of the choroid may be mechanistically linked to the scleral synthesis of macromolecules, and thus may play an important role in the homeostatic control of eye growth, and, consequently, in the etiology of myopia and hyperopia. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

RNA staining methods assay only a small number of transcripts, whereas single-cell RNA-seq, which measures global gene expression, separates cells from their native spatial context. Here we present Seurat, a computational strategy to infer cellular localization by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data with in situ RNA patterns. We applied Seurat to spatially map 851 single cells from dissociated zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and generated a transcriptome-wide map of spatial patterning. We confirmed Seurat's accuracy using several experimental approaches, then used the strategy to identify a set of archetypal expression patterns and spatial markers. Seurat correctly localizes rare subpopulations, accurately mapping both spatially restricted and scattered groups. Seurat will be applicable to mapping cellular localization within complex patterned tissues in diverse systems.},

abstract = {The human cell surface molecule CD34 is selectively expressed on uncommitted and committed hematopoietic progenitor cells and on vascular endothelial cells. It has been suggested that CD34 regulates early events in blood cell migration and differentiation, possibly as a cell adhesion molecule. To characterize the patterns of expression of CD34 in the mouse embryo and in the adult, as well as to dissect the function of different portions of the extracellular domain of this molecule, we have generated the first monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for mouse CD34. The epitope(s) recognized by these mAb are not carbohydrate moieties, and are comprised either within the immunoglobulin‐like domain or within a portion of the mucin domain, containing approximately half of the predicted O‐ and N‐linked carbohydrate attachment sites. The specificity of the antibodies was established by ELISA and Western blotting. Western analysis revealed that these mAb recognize a protein of approximately 110 kDa in PA6 stromal cell lysates, which can be specifically blocked by the recombinant CD34 protein. To establish the reactivity of these mAb on different cell lineages, a panel of cell lines was stained. This analysis showed strong reactivities with 3T3 fibroblasts, stromal cell lines from fetal liver and with the endothelial cell line D10. Bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors were also stained by these mAb. Immunostaining of frozen sections from embryonic and adult tissues revealed a strong reactivity against vascular endothelial cells at different stages of development, including sinusoidal cells in the fetal liver, yolk sac, and in the fetal bone marrow, endothelial cells from adult lung and kidney, and neural cells, including those of the neural tube of midgestation embryos and neuronal bodies in adult brain.

abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex eye disease that affects millions of people worldwide and is the main reason for legal blindness and vision loss in the elderly in developed countries. Although the cause of AMD pathogenesis is not known, oxidative stress-related damage to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is considered an early event inAMDinduction. However, the precise cause of such damage and of the induction of oxidative stress, including related oxidative effects occurring in RPE and the onset and progression of AMD, are not well understood. Many results point to mitochondria as a source of elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AMD. This ROS increase can be associated with aging and effects induced by other AMD risk factors and is correlated with damage to mitochondrial DNA. Therefore, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage can be an essential element of AMD pathogenesis. This is supported by many studies that show a greater susceptibility of mtDNA than nuclear DNA to DNA-damaging agents in AMD. Therefore, the mitochondrial DNA damage reaction (mtDDR) is important in AMD prevention and in slowing down its progression as is ROS-targeting AMD therapy. However, we know far less about mtDNA than its nuclear counterparts. Further research should measure DNA damage in order to compare it in mitochondria and the nucleus, as current methods have serious disadvantages},

abstract = {The identification of maximally homologous subsequences among sets of long sequences is an important problem in tnolecular sequence analysis. The problem is straightforward only if one restricts consideration to cont.igucws subsequences (segments) containing no internal deletions or insertions. The more general problem has its solution in an extension of sequence metrics (Sellers 19i.i: IVaterman el al.. 1976) developed to measure the mininlunl number of "et-cntsr' required to convert one sequence into another. These developments in t.he modern sequence analysis began with the heuristic homology algorithm of Seedleman {\&} Wunsch (1970) which first introduced an iterative matrix method of calculation. Sumerous other heuristic algorithms have been suggested including those of Fitch (1966) and Dayhoff (1969). More mathernat- icallg rigorous algorithms were suggested by Sankoff (1972), Reichert. ef d. (1973) and Beyer el d. (1979), but these were generally not biologically satisfjing or interpretable. Successcame with Sellers (19i4) development of a true metric measure of the distance betweef: sequences. This metric was later generalized by Waterman et al. (1976) to include deletions/insertions of arbitrary length. This metric represents the minimum number of "mutat.iona1 events'' required t,o convert one sequence into another. It is of interest to n0t.e that Smith et al. (1980) hare recently shown that under some conditions the original homology algorithm of Seedleman S. Wunsch (19iO). In this letter we extend the above ideas to find a pair of segments. one from each of two long sequences. such that there is no other pair of segments with greater similarity (homology).

abstract = {In the past few years, significant technological breakthroughs in single particle cryo-electron microscopy enabled a ‘resolution revolution' of this technique. It also changed structural biology in an unprecedented way. For many biological macromolecules, obtaining well-ordered crystals of suitable size is no longer a prerequisite for determining their atomic structures. One of the most impacted areas is the structural biology of integral membrane proteins. New structures are now determined at a rapid pace. Despite these advances, further technological developments are still required to overcome new technical challenges that face membrane protein structural biology. In this review, I attempt to discuss some of these challenges.},

abstract = {Single particle cryo-EM has recently developed into a powerful tool to determine the 3D structure of macromolecular complexes at near-atomic resolution, which allows structural biologists to build atomic models of proteins. All technical aspects of cryo-EM technology have been considerably improved over the last two decades, including electron microscopic hardware, image processing software and the ever growing speed of computers. This leads to a more widespread use of the technique, and it can be anticipated that further automation of electron microscopes and image processing tools will soon fully shift the focus away from the technological aspects, onto biological questions that can be answered. In single particle cryo-EM, no crystals of a macromolecule are required. In contrast to X-ray crystallography, this significantly facilitates structure determination by cryo-EM. Nevertheless, a relatively high level of biochemical control is still essential to obtain high-resolution structures by cryo-EM, and it can be anticipated that the success of the cryo-EM technology goes hand in hand with further developments of sample purification and preparation techniques. This will allow routine high-resolution structure determination of the many macromolecular complexes of the cell that until now represent evasive targets for X-ray crystallographers. Here we discuss the various biochemical tools that are currently available and the existing sample purification and preparation techniques for cryo-EM grid preparation that are needed to obtain high-resolution images for structure determination.},

We investigated the molecular signature of microglia and identified 239 genes and 8 microRNAs that were uniquely or highly expressed in microglia versus myeloid and other immune cells. Of the 239 genes, 106 were enriched in microglia as compared with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons. This microglia signature was not observed in microglial lines or in monocytes recruited to the CNS, and was also observed in human microglia. We found that TGF-$\beta$ was required for the in vitro development of microglia that express the microglial molecular signature characteristic of adult microglia and that microglia were absent in the CNS of TGF-$\beta$1-deficient mice. Our results identify a unique microglial signature that is dependent on TGF-$\beta$ signaling and provide insights into microglial biology and the possibility of targeting microglia for the treatment of CNS disease.},

abstract = {Metabolomics is a relatively new field of 'omics' technology that is primarily concerned with the global or system-wide characterization of small molecule metabolites using technologies such as nuclear magnetic resonance, liquid chromatography and/or mass spectrometry. Its unique focus on small molecules and the physiological effects of small molecules aligns the field of metabolomics very closely with the aims and interests of many researchers in the pharmaceutical industry. Because of its conceptual and technical overlap with many aspects of pharmaceutical research, metabolomics is now finding applications that span almost the full length of the drug discovery and development pipeline, from lead compound discovery to post-approval drug surveillance. This review explores some of the most interesting or significant applications of metabolomics as they relate to pharmaceutical research and development. Specific examples are given that show how metabolomics can be used to facilitate lead compound discovery, to improve biomarker identification (for monitoring disease status and drug efficacy) and to monitor drug metabolism and toxicity. Other applications are also discussed, including the use of metabolomics to facilitate clinical trial testing and to improve post-approval drug monitoring. These examples show that metabolomics potentially offer drug researchers and drug regulators an effective, inexpensive route to addressing many of the riskier or more expensive issues associated with the discovery, development and monitoring of drug products.},

Despite keen interest in understanding how TFs control gene expression, it remains challenging to determine how the precise genomic binding sites of TFs are specified and how TF binding ultimately relates to regulation of transcription. This review considers how TFs are identified and functionally characterized, principally through the lens of a catalog of over 1,600 likely human TFs and binding motifs for two-thirds of them. Major classes of human TFs differ markedly in their evolutionary trajectories and expression patterns, underscoring distinct functions. TFs likewise underlie many different aspects of human physiology, disease, and variation, highlighting the importance of continued effort to understand TF-mediated gene regulation. Knowing how and where transcription factors bind to the genome is crucial for understanding how they control gene expression. This Review looks at how human TFs are identified and the ways they interact with DNA sequences.},

However, we have limited understanding of the timing of key events in the developing human retina, and in particular the factors critical for generating the unique architecture of the fovea and surrounding macula. Here we define three key epochs in the transcriptome dynamics of human retina from fetal day (D) 52 to 136. Coincident histological analyses confirmed the cellular basis of transcriptional changes and highlighted the dramatic acceleration of development in the fovea compared with peripheral retina. Human and mouse retinal transcriptomes show remarkable similarity in developmental stages, although morphogenesis was greatly expanded in humans. Integration of DNA accessibility data allowed us to reconstruct transcriptional networks controlling photoreceptor differentiation. Our studies provide insights into human retinal development and serve as a resource for molecular staging of human stem-cell-derived retinal organoids. Hoshino et al. describe transcriptome dynamics and spatiotemporal analyses of developing human retina, demonstrating distinct periods of neurogenesis in the fovea versus nasal retina. Comparison with mouse retinal transcriptomes and integration with open chromatin datasets reveal evolutionary conservation of developmental regulatory networks and unique characteristics of human retinal differentiation.},

abstract = {Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) provide a simple model for studying essential hypertension. Their genetic and metabolic features are of great interest because they may provide insights into the pathophysiological processes underlying essential hypertension. We have thus investigated the metabolic characteristics of SHR at various ages, covering the prehypertensive stage and the developmental phase of hypertension, using a (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomic approach. Twenty-four-hour urine samples from the SHR and their age-matched normotensive control, Wistar-Kyoto rats, were analyzed using (1)H NMR spectroscopy, and the spectral data were subjected to principal components analysis (PCA) to find metabolic differences between the two strains. Consequently, it was possible to separate the urine samples between the two strains at any age ranging from 4 to 20 weeks in the principal component scores plots. The major spectral regions and signals (metabolites) contributing to the separation were picked up based on the loadings. Subsequently, the urinary excreted levels of metabolites highlighted by the PCA were compared based on the signal intensities corrected by urine volume and body weight. These investigations revealed the major metabolic changes characteristic of the SHR, which included differences in citrate, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, succinate, hippurate, phenylacetylglycine, p-cresol glucuronide, creatine, taurine, medium-chain dicarboxylates (tentative), unknown ($\delta$ 3.11), and the regions at 3.60, 3.64, 3.68 and 3.88 p.p.m. The results supported the occurrence of metabolic acidosis in the SHR in the period of prehypertension as well as rapidly rising blood pressure. In addition, the intestinal microfloral populations in the SHR were suggested to be altered in the developmental phase of hypertension.Hypertension Research advance online publication, 17 November 2011; doi:10.1038/hr.2011.182.},

abstract = {Subpopulation identification, usually via some form of unsupervised clustering, is a fundamental step in the analysis of many single-cell RNA-seq data sets. This has motivated the development and application of a broad range of clustering methods, based on various underlying algorithms. Here, we provide a systematic and extensible performance evaluation of 14 clustering algorithms implemented in R, including both methods developed explicitly for scRNA-seq data and more general-purpose methods. The methods were evaluated using nine publicly available scRNA-seq data sets as well as three simulations with varying degree of cluster separability. The same feature selection approaches were used for all methods, allowing us to focus on the investigation of the performance of the clustering algorithms themselves.We evaluated the ability of recovering known subpopulations, the stability and the run time and scalability of the methods. Additionally, we investigated whether the performance could be improved by generating consensus partitions from multiple individual clustering methods. We found substantial differences in the performance, run time and stability between the methods, with SC3 and Seurat showing the most favorable results. Additionally, we found that consensus clustering typically did not improve the performance compared to the best of the combined methods, but that several of the top-performing methods already perform some type of consensus clustering. All the code used for the evaluation is available on GitHub ( https://github.com/markrobinsonuzh/scRNAseq{\_}clustering{\_}comparison ). In addition, an R package providing access to data and clustering results, thereby facilitating inclusion of new methods and data sets, is available from Bioconductor ( https://bioconductor.org/packages/DuoClustering2018 ). },

We designed precomputed light sequences based on experimentally calibrated mathematical models of light-switchable two-component systems and used them to drive intracellular protein levels to match user-defined reference time courses. We used this approach to generate accelerated and linearized dynamics, sinusoidal oscillations with desired amplitudes and periods, and a complex waveform, all with unprecedented accuracy and precision. We also combined the function generator with a dual fluorescent protein reporter system, analogous to a dual-channel oscilloscope, to reveal that a synthetic repressible promoter linearly transforms repressor signals with an approximate 7-min delay. Our approach will enable a new generation of dynamical analyses of synthetic and natural gene circuits, providing an essential step toward the predictive design and rigorous understanding of biological systems.},

To help fill this knowledge gap, we characterized 57,979 cells from healthy mouse kidneys by using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing. On the basis of gene expression patterns, we infer that inherited kidney diseases that arise from distinct genetic mutations but share the same phenotypic manifestation originate from the same differentiated cell type. We also found that the collecting duct in kidneys of adult mice generates a spectrum of cell types through a newly identified transitional cell. Computational cell trajectory analysis and in vivo lineage tracing revealed that intercalated cells and principal cells undergo transitions mediated by the Notch signaling pathway. In mouse and human kidney disease, these transitions were shifted toward a principal cell fate and were associated with metabolic acidosis.},

abstract = {Microglia, the tissue-resident macrophages in the brain, are damage sensors that react to nearly any perturbation, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we determined the transcriptome of more than 1,600 individual microglia cells isolated from the hippocampus of a mouse model of severe neurodegeneration with AD-like phenotypes and of control mice at multiple time points during progression of neurodegeneration. In this neurodegeneration model, we discovered two molecularly distinct reactive microglia phenotypes that are typified by modules of co-regulated type I and type II interferon response genes, respectively. Furthermore, our work identified previously unobserved heterogeneity in the response of microglia to neurodegeneration, discovered disease stage-specific microglia cell states, revealed the trajectory of cellular reprogramming of microglia in response to neurodegeneration, and uncovered the underlying transcriptional programs. Mathys et al. use single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the phenotypic heterogeneity of microglia during the progression of neurodegeneration. They identify multiple disease stage-specific cell states, including two molecularly distinct reactive microglia phenotypes that are typified by modules of co-regulated type I and type II interferon response genes, respectively.},

abstract = {High-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) promises simultaneous transcript discovery and abundance estimation. However, this would require algorithms that are not restricted by prior gene annotations and that account for alternative transcription and splicing. Here we introduce such algorithms in an open-source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed {\textgreater}430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62{\%} of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.},

abstract = {Removal of, or adjustment for, batch effects or center differences is generally required when such effects are present in data. In particular, when preparing microarray gene expression data from multiple cohorts, array platforms, or batches for later analyses, batch effects can have confounding effects, inducing spurious differences between study groups. Many methods and tools exist for removing batch effects from data. However, when study groups are not evenly distributed across batches, actual group differences may induce apparent batch differences, in which case batch adjustments may bias, usually deflate, group differences. Some tools therefore have the option of preserving the difference between study groups, e.g. using a two-way ANOVA model to simultaneously estimate both group and batch effects. Unfortunately, this approach may systematically induce incorrect group differences in downstream analyses when groups are distributed between the batches in an unbalanced manner. The scientific community seems to be largely unaware of how this approach may lead to false discoveries.},

To date, yeast has been the most successful heterologous overexpression system in producing eukaryotic membrane proteins for high-resolution structural studies. For this reason, we have developed a protocol for rapidly screening and purifying eukaryotic membrane proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using this protocol, in 1 week many genes can be rapidly cloned by homologous recombination into a 2 l GFP-fusion vector and their overexpression potential determined using whole-cell and in-gel fluorescence. The quality of the overproduced eukaryotic membrane protein-GFP fusions can then be evaluated over several days using confocal microscopy and fluorescence size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC). This protocol also details the purification of targets that pass our quality criteria, and can be scaled up for a large number of eukaryotic membrane proteins in either an academic, structural genomics or commercial environment.},

What is limiting is an effective way to routinely isolate and process large numbers of individual cells for quantitative in-depth sequencing. We have developed a high-throughput droplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the RNA from thousands of individual cells for subsequent analysis by next-generation sequencing. The method shows a surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based assays. We analyzed mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing in detail the population structure and the heterogeneous onset of differentiation after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. The reproducibility of these high-throughput single-cell data allowed us to deconstruct cell populations and infer gene expression relationships.},

The genome containing the biological information of an individual can be represented by a sequence of length {\$}G{\$}. Many observable characteristics of individuals can be related to a subsequence of a given length {\$}L{\$} called causal subsequence. The environmental affects make the relation between the causal subsequence and the observable characteristics a stochastic function. Our objective in this paper is to detect the causal subsequence of a specific phenotype using a dataset of {\$}N{\$} individuals and their observed characteristics. We introduce an abstract formulation of GWAS which allows us to investigate the problem from an information theoretic perspective. In particular, as the parameters {\$}N,G,{\$} and {\$}L{\$} grow, we observe a threshold effect at {\$}\backslashfrac{\{}Gh(L/G){\}}{\{}N{\}}{\$}, where {\$}h(.){\$} is the binary entropy function. This effect allows us to define the capacity of recovering the causal subsequence by denoting the rate of the GWAS problem as {\$}\backslashfrac{\{}Gh(L/G){\}}{\{}N{\}}{\$}. We develop an achievable scheme and a matching converse for this problem, and thus characterize its capacity in two scenarios: the zero-error-rate and the {\$}\backslashepsilon-{\$}error-rate.},

abstract = {P2X receptors are trimeric ATP-activated ion channels permeable to Na+, K+ and Ca2+. The seven P2X receptor subtypes are implicated in physiological processes that include modulation of synaptic transmission, contraction of smooth muscle, secretion of chemical transmitters and regulation of immune responses. Despite the importance of P2X receptors in cellular physiology, the three-dimensional composition of the ATP-binding site, the structural mechanism of ATP-dependent ion channel gating and the architecture of the open ion channel pore are unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the zebrafish P2X4 receptor in complex with ATP and a new structure of the apo receptor. The agonist-bound structure reveals a previously unseen ATP-binding motif and an open ion channel pore. ATP binding induces cleft closure of the nucleotide-binding pocket, flexing of the lower body $\beta$-sheet and a radial expansion of the extracellular vestibule. The structural widening of the extracellular vestibule is directly coupled to the opening of the ion channel pore by way of an iris-like expansion of the transmembrane helices. The structural delineation of the ATP-binding site and the ion channel pore, together with the conformational changes associated with ion channel gating, will stimulate development of new pharmacological agents.},

abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex eye disease underlined by the death of photoreceptors and degeneration of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choriocapillaris (CC). The mechanism(s) responsible for massive and progressive retinal degeneration is not completely known. Senescence, a state of permanent inhibition of cell growth, may be induced by many factors important for AMD pathogenesis and results in senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that releases growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, proteases and other molecules inducing inflammation and other AMD-related effects. These effects can be induced in the affected cell and neighboring cells, leading to progression of AMD phenotype. Senescent cells also release reactive oxygen species that increase SASP propagation. Many other pathways of senescence-related AMD pathogenesis, including autophagy, the cGAS–STING signaling, degeneration of CC by membrane attack complex, can be considered. A2E, a fluorophore present in lipofuscin, amyloid-beta peptide and humanin, a mitochondria-derived peptide, may link AMD with senescence. Further studies on senescence in AMD pathogenesis to check the possibility of opening a perspective of the use of drugs killing senescent cells (senolytics) and terminating SASP bystander effects (senostatics) might be beneficial for AMD that at present is an incurable disease.},

abstract = {We used Bayesian regularized neural networks to model data on the MHC class II-binding affinity of peptides. Training data consisted of sequences and binding data for nonamer (nine amino acid) peptides. Independent test data consisted of sequences and binding data for peptides of length ≤25. We assumed that MHC class II-binding activity of peptides depends only on the highest ranked embedded nonamer and that reverse sequences of active nonamers are inactive. We also internally validated the models by using 30{\%} of the training data in an internal test set. We obtained robust models, with near identical statistics for multiple training runs. We determined how predictive our models were using statistical tests and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) graphs (AROC). Most models gave training A ROC values close to 1.0 and test set AROC values {\textgreater}0.8. We also used both amino acid indicator variables (bin20) and property-based descriptors to generate models for MHC class II-binding of peptides. The property-based descriptors were more parsimonious than the indicator variable descriptors, making them applicable to larger peptides, and their design makes them able to generalize to unknown peptides outside of the training space. None of the external test data sets contained any of the nonamer sequences in the training sets. Consequently, the models attempted to predict the activity of truly unknown peptides not encountered in the training sets. Our models were well able to tackle the difficult problem of correctly predicting the MHC class II-binding activities of a majority of the test set peptides. Exceptions to the assumption that nonamer motif activities were invariant to the peptide in which they were embedded, together with the limited coverage of the test data, and the fuzziness of the classification procedure, are likely explanations for some misclassifications. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction and loss are a hallmark of non-neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NNAMD). Without the RPE, a majority of overlying photoreceptors ultimately degenerate, leading to severe, progressive vision loss. Clinical and histological studies suggest that RPE replacement strategies may delay disease progression or restore vision. A prospective, interventional, U.S. Food and Drug Administration-cleared, phase 1/2a study is being conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of a composite subretinal implant in subjects with advanced NNAMD. The composite implant, termed the California Project to Cure Blindness-Retinal Pigment Epithelium 1 (CPCB-RPE1), consists of a polarized monolayer of human embryonic stem cell-derived RPE (hESC-RPE) on an ultrathin, synthetic parylene substrate designed to mimic Bruch's membrane. We report an interim analysis of the phase 1 cohort consisting of five subjects. Four of five subjects enrolled in the study successfully received the composite implant. In all implanted subjects, optical coherence tomography imaging showed changes consistent with hESC-RPE and host photoreceptor integration. None of the implanted eyes showed progression of vision loss, one eye improved by 17 letters and two eyes demonstrated improved fixation. The concurrent structural and functional findings suggest that CPCB-RPE1 may improve visual function, at least in the short term, in some patients with severe vision loss from advanced NNAMD.},

abstract = {The potential for astrocyte participation in central nervous system recovery is highlighted by in vitro experiments demonstrating their capacity to transdifferentiate into neurons. Understanding astrocyte plasticity could be advanced by comparing astrocytes with stem cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is ideal for comparing differences across cell types. However, this novel multi-stage process has the potential to introduce unwanted technical variation at several points in the experimental workflow. Quantitative understanding of the contribution of experimental parameters to technical variation would facilitate the design of robust RNA-Seq experiments. RNA-Seq was used to achieve biological and technical objectives. The biological aspect compared gene expression between normal human fetal-derived astrocytes and human neural stem cells cultured in identical conditions. When differential expression threshold criteria of |log2 fold change| {\textgreater} 2 were applied to the data, no significant differences were observed. The technical component quantified variation arising from particular steps in the research pathway, and compared the ability of different normalization methods to reduce unwanted variance. To facilitate this objective, a liberal false discovery rate of 10{\%} and a |log2 fold change| {\textgreater} 0.5 were implemented for the differential expression threshold. Data were normalized with RPKM, TMM, and UQS methods using JMP Genomics. The contributions of key replicable experimental parameters (cell lot; library preparation; flow cell) to variance in the data were evaluated using principal variance component analysis. Our analysis showed that, although the variance for every parameter is strongly influenced by the normalization method, the largest contributor to technical variance was library preparation. The ability to detect differentially expressed genes was also affected by normalization; differences were only detected in non-normalized and TMM-normalized data. The similarity in gene expression between astrocytes and neural stem cells supports the potential for astrocytic transdifferentiation into neurons, and emphasizes the need to evaluate the therapeutic potential of astrocytes for central nervous system damage. The choice of normalization method influences the contributions to experimental variance as well as the outcomes of differential expression analysis. However irrespective of normalization method, our findings illustrate that library preparation contributed the largest component of technical variance.},

This design method minimizes primer dimerization and ensures the priority of primer-template annealing over primer self-pairing during the PCR. Several different multiple mutations (up to 7 bases) were successfully performed with this partial overlapping primer design in a variety of vectors ranging from 4 to 12 kb in length. In comparison, all attempts failed when using complete-overlapping primer pairs as recommended in the standard QuickChange protocol. Our protocol was further extended to site-saturation mutagenesis by introducing randomized codons. Our data indicated no specific sequence selection during library construction, with the randomized positions resulting in average occurrence of each base in each position. This method should be useful to facilitate the preparation of high-quality site saturation libraries.},

Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Macrophages are crucial drivers of tumour-promoting inflammation. Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute to tumour progression at different levels: by promoting genetic instability, nurturing cancer stem cells, supporting metastasis, and taming protective adaptive immunity. TAMs can exert a dual, yin-yang influence on the effectiveness of cytoreductive therapies (chemotherapy and radiotherapy), either antagonizing the antitumour activity of these treatments by orchestrating a tumour-promoting, tissue-repair response or, instead, enhancing the overall antineoplastic effect. TAMs express molecular triggers of checkpoint proteins that regulate T-cell activation, and are targets of certain checkpoint-blockade immunotherapies. Other macrophage-centred approaches to anticancer therapy are under investigation, and include: inhibition of macrophage recruitment to, and/or survival in, tumours; functional re-education of TAMs to an antitumour, 'M1-like' mode; and tumour-targeting monoclonal antibodies that elicit macrophage-mediated extracellular killing, or phagocytosis and intracellular destruction of cancer cells. The evidence supporting these strategies is reviewed herein. We surmise that TAMs can provide tools to tailor the use of cytoreductive therapies and immunotherapy in a personalized medicine approach, and that TAM-focused therapeutic strategies have the potential to complement and synergize with both chemotherapy and immunotherapy.},

We use these data to link regulatory elements to their target genes, to define the transcription factor grammar specifying each cell type, and to discover in vivo correlates of heterogeneity in accessibility within cell types. We develop a technique for mapping single cell gene expression data to single-cell chromatin accessibility data, facilitating the comparison of atlases. By intersecting mouse chromatin accessibility with human genome-wide association summary statistics, we identify cell-type-specific enrichments of the heritability signal for hundreds of complex traits.

More recently, however, increasingly sophisticated applications have been pursued. Examples include comparing compound intensities between multiple sample groups and unbiasedly tracking the fate of specific isotopic labels. The latter types of applications have necessitated the development of new software programs, which have introduced additional functionalities that facilitate data analysis. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the freely available bioinformatic solutions that are either based upon or are compatible with the algorithms in XCMS, which we broadly refer to here as the 'XCMS family' of software.

To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from 'regularized negative binomial regression', where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation, and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat.},

abstract = {Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) mediate several cellular functions including cell adhesion, ion and nutrient transport, and cell signalling. IMPs are typically hard to isolate and purify due to their hydrophobic nature and low cellular abundance, however, microsomes are small lipid vesicles rich in IMPs, which form spontaneously when cells are mechanically disrupted. In this study, we have employed mouse liver microsomes as a model for optimising a method for IMP isolation and characterisation. Microsomes were collected by differential centrifugation, purified with sodium carbonate, and subjected to GeLC-MS/MS analysis. A total of 1124 proteins were identified in the microsome fraction, with 47{\%} (524/1124) predicted by TMHMM to contain at least one transmembrane domain (TMD). The ability of phase partitioning using the detergent Triton X-114 (TX-114) to further enrich for membrane proteins was evaluated. Microsomes were subjected to successive rounds of solubility-based phase separation, with proteins partitioning into the aqueous phase, detergent phase, or TX-114-insoluble pellet fraction. GeLC-MS/MS analysis of the three TX-114 fractions identified 1212 proteins, of which 146 were not detected in the un-fractionated microsome sample.

GO Slim characterisation of the microsome proteome revealed enrichment of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, endosome, and cytoplasm. Further, enzymes including monooxygenases were well represented with 35 cytochrome P450 identifications (CYPs 1A2, 2A5, 2A12, 2B10, 2C29, 2C37, 2C39, 2C44, 2C50, 2C54. 2C67, 2C68, 2C70, 2D10, 2D11, 2D22, 2D26, 2D9, 2E1, 2F2, 2J5, 2U1, 3A11, 3A13, 3A25, 4A10, 4A12A, 4A12B, 4F13, 4F14, 4F15, 4V3, 51,7B1, and 8B1). Evaluation of biological processes showed enrichment of proteins involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and elongation, as well as steroid synthesis. In addition, transport proteins including 24 members of the Rab family of GTPases were identified. Comparison of this dataset with the current mouse liver microsome proteome contributes an additional 648 protein identifications, of which 50{\%} (326/648) contain at least one TMD. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites is an accurate method of identifying the location of genetic regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions. We employed high-throughput sequencing and whole-genome tiled array strategies to identify DNase I HS sites within human primary CD4+ T cells. Combining these two technologies, we have created a comprehensive and accurate genome-wide open chromatin map. Surprisingly, only 16{\%}-21{\%} of the identified 94,925 DNase I HS sites are found in promoters or first exons of known genes, but nearly half of the most open sites are in these regions. In conjunction with expression, motif, and chromatin immunoprecipitation data, we find evidence of cell-type-specific characteristics, including the ability to identify transcription start sites and locations of different chromatin marks utilized in these cells. In addition, and unexpectedly, our analyses have uncovered detailed features of nucleosome structure. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The choroid is richly innervated by parasympathetic, sympathetic and trigeminal sensory nerve fibers that regulate choroidal blood flow in birds and mammals, and presumably other vertebrate classes as well. The parasympathetic innervation has been shown to vasodilate and increase choroidal blood flow, the sympathetic input has been shown to vasoconstrict and decrease choroidal blood flow, and the sensory input has been shown to both convey pain and thermal information centrally and act locally to vasodilate and increase choroidal blood flow. As the choroid lies behind the retina and cannot respond readily to retinal metabolic signals, its innervation is important for adjustments in flow required by either retinal activity, by fluctuations in the systemic blood pressure driving choroidal perfusion, and possibly by retinal temperature. The former two appear to be mediated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, via central circuits responsive to retinal activity and systemic blood pressure, but adjustments for ocular perfusion pressure also appear to be influenced by local autoregulatory myogenic mechanisms. Adaptive choroidal responses to temperature may be mediated by trigeminal sensory fibers. Impairments in the neural control of choroidal blood flow occur with aging, and various ocular or systemic diseases such as glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), hypertension, and diabetes, and may contribute to retinal pathology and dysfunction in these conditions, or in the case of AMD be a precondition. The present manuscript reviews findings in birds and mammals that contribute to the above-summarized understanding of the roles of the autonomic and sensory innervation of the choroid in controlling choroidal blood flow, and in the importance of such regulation for maintaining retinal health.},

Yet, little is known about the cell-cell interactions that imprint the tissue-specific identities of macrophages in their respective niches. Using conditional depletion of liver Kupffer cells, we traced the developmental stages of monocytes differentiating into Kupffer cells and mapped the cellular interactions imprinting the Kupffer cell identity. Kupffer cell loss induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-dependent activation of stellate cells and endothelial cells, resulting in the transient production of chemokines and adhesion molecules orchestrating monocyte engraftment. Engrafted circulating monocytes transmigrated into the perisinusoidal space and acquired the liver-associated transcription factors inhibitor of DNA 3 (ID3) and liver X receptor-$\alpha$ (LXR-$\alpha$). Coordinated interactions with hepatocytes induced ID3 expression, whereas endothelial cells and stellate cells induced LXR-$\alpha$ via a synergistic NOTCH-BMP pathway. This study shows that the Kupffer cell niche is composed of stellate cells, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells that together imprint the liver-specific macrophage identity.},

Here we describe MARIA (major histocompatibility complex analysis with recurrent integrated architecture; https://maria.stanford.edu/ ), a multimodal recurrent neural network for predicting the likelihood of antigen presentation from a gene of interest in the context of specific HLA class II alleles. In addition to in vitro binding measurements, MARIA is trained on peptide HLA ligand sequences identified by mass spectrometry, expression levels of antigen genes and protease cleavage signatures. Because it leverages these diverse training data and our improved machine learning framework, MARIA (area under the curve = 0.89-0.92) outperformed existing methods in validation datasets. Across independent cancer neoantigen studies, peptides with high MARIA scores are more likely to elicit strong CD4+ T cell responses. MARIA allows identification of immunogenic epitopes in diverse cancers and autoimmune disease.},

@article{Smalheiser2015a,
abstract = {When a field shares the consensus that a particular phenomenon does NOT occur, this may reflect extensive experimental investigations with negative outcomes, or may represent the "common sense" position based on current knowledge and established ways of thinking. The current consensus of the RNA field is that eukaryotic Argonaute (Ago) proteins employ RNA guides and target other RNAs. The alternative -- that eukaryotic Ago has biologically important interactions with DNA in vivo - has not been seriously considered, in part because the only role contemplated for DNA was as a guide strand, and in part because it did not seem plausible that any natural source of suitable DNAs exists in eukaryotic cells. However, eukaryotic Argonaute domains bind DNA in the test tube, and several articles report that small inhibitory double-stranded DNAs do have the ability to silence target RNAs in a sequence-dependent (though poorly characterized) manner. A search of the literature identified potential DNA binding partners for Ago, including (among others) single-stranded DNAs residing in extracellular vesicles, and cytoplasmic satellite-repeat DNA fragments that are associated with the plasma membrane and transcribed by Pol II. It is interesting to note that both cytoplasmic and extracellular vesicle DNA are expressed at greatly elevated levels in cancer cells relative to normal cells. In such a pathological scenario, if not under normal conditions, there may be appreciable binding of Ago to DNA despite its lower affinity compared to RNA. If so, DNA might displace Ago from binding to its normal partners (miRNAs, siRNAs and other short ncRNAs), disrupting tightly controlled post-transcriptional gene silencing processes that are vital to correct functioning of a normal cell. The possible contribution to cancer pathogenesis is a strong motivator for further investigation of Ago-DNA binding. More generally, this case underscores the need for better informatics tools to allow investigators to analyze the state of a given scientific question at a high-level and to identify possible new research directions.},

abstract = {Chemokines and their receptors such as CCR2 and CX3CR1 mediate leukocyte adhesion and migration into injured tissue. To further define mechanisms of monocyte trafficking during kidney injury we identified two groups of F4/80-positive cells (F4/80low and F4/80high) in the normal mouse kidney that phenotypically correspond to macrophages and dendritic cells, respectively. Following ischemia and 3 h of reperfusion, there was a large influx of F4/80low inflamed monocytes, but not dendritic cells, into the kidney. These monocytes produced TNF-$\alpha$, IL-6, IL-1$\alpha$ and IL-12. Ischemic injury induced in CCR2-/- mice or in CCR2 +/+ mice, made chimeric with CCR2-/- bone marrow, resulted in lower plasma creatinine levels and their kidneys had fewer infiltrated F4/80low macrophages compared to control mice. CX3CR1 expression contributed to monocyte recruitment into inflamed kidneys, as ischemic injury in CX3CR1-/- mice was reduced, with fewer F4/80low macrophages than controls. Monocytes transferred from CCR2+/+ or CX3CR1+/- mice migrated into reperfused kidneys better than monocytes from either CCR2-/- or CX3CR1-/- mice. Adoptive transfer of monocytes from CCR2+/+ mice, but not CCR2-/- mice, reversed the protective effect in CCR2-/- mice following ischemia-reperfusion. Egress of CD11b+Ly6Chigh monocytes from blood into inflamed kidneys was CCR2- and CX3CR1-dependent. Our study shows that inflamed monocyte migration, through CCR2- and CX3CR1-dependent mechanisms, plays a critical role in kidney injury following ischemia reperfusion. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Society of Nephrology.},

abstract = {Purpose: To characterize the plasma metabolomic profile of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using mass spectrometry (MS). Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Participants: We prospectively recruited participants with a diagnosis of AMD and a control group ({\textgreater}50 years of age) without any vitreoretinal disease. Methods: All participants underwent color fundus photography, used for AMD diagnosis and staging, according to the Age-Related Eye Disease Study classification scheme. Fasting blood samples were collected and plasma was analyzed by Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC), using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and high-resolution MS. Metabolon's hardware and software were used to identify peaks and control quality. Principal component analysis and multivariate regression were performed to assess differences in the metabolomic profiles of AMD patients versus controls, while controlling for potential confounders. For biological interpretation, pathway enrichment analysis of significant metabolites was performed using MetaboAnalyst. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures were levels of plasma metabolites in participants with AMD compared with controls and among different AMD severity stages. Results: We included 90 participants with AMD (30 with early AMD, 30 with intermediate AMD, and 30 with late AMD) and 30 controls. Using UPLC and MS, 878 biochemicals were identified. Multivariate logistic regression identified 87 metabolites with levels that differed significantly between AMD patients and controls. Most of these metabolites (82.8{\%}; n = 72), including the most significant metabolites, belonged to the lipid pathways. Analysis of variance revealed that of the 87 metabolites, 48 (55.2{\%}) also were significantly different across the different stages of AMD. A significant enrichment of the glycerophospholipids pathway was identified (P = 4.7 × 10−9) among these metabolites. Conclusions: Participants with AMD have altered plasma metabolomic profiles compared with controls. Our data suggest that the most significant metabolites map to the glycerophospholipid pathway. These findings have the potential to improve our understanding of AMD pathogenesis, to support the development of plasma-based metabolomics biomarkers of AMD, and to identify novel targets for treatment of this blinding disease.},

Here we profile the epigenetic and transcriptional changes that occur during retinogenesis in mice and humans. Although some progenitor genes and cell cycle genes were epigenetically silenced during retinogenesis, the most dramatic change was derepression of cell-type-specific differentiation programs. We identified developmental-stage-specific super-enhancers and showed that most epigenetic changes are conserved in humans and mice. To determine how the epigenome changes during tumorigenesis and reprogramming, we performed integrated epigenetic analysis of murine and human retinoblastomas and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from murine rod photoreceptors. The retinoblastoma epigenome mapped to the developmental stage when retinal progenitors switch from neurogenic to terminal patterns of cell division. The epigenome of retinoblastomas was more similar to that of the normal retina than that of retina-derived iPSCs, and we identified retina-specific epigenetic memory.},

abstract = {The predominance of partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) used to analyze metabolomics datasets (indeed, it is the most well-known tool to perform classification and regression in metabolomics), can be said to have led to the point that not all researchers are fully aware of alternative multivariate classification algorithms. This may in part be due to the widespread availability of PLS-DA in most of the well-known statistical software packages, where its implementation is very easy if the default settings are used. In addition, one of the perceived advantages of PLS-DA is that it has the ability to analyze highly collinear and noisy data. Furthermore, the calibration model is known to provide a variety of useful statistics, such as prediction accuracy as well as scores and loadings plots. However, this method may provide misleading results, largely due to a lack of suitable statistical validation, when used by non-experts who are not aware of its potential limitations when used in conjunction with metabolomics. This tutorial review aims to provide an introductory overview to several straightforward statistical methods such as principal component-discriminant function analysis (PC-DFA), support vector machines (SVM) and random forests (RF), which could very easily be used either to augment PLS or as alternative supervised learning methods to PLS-DA. These methods can be said to be particularly appropriate for the analysis of large, highly-complex data sets which are common output(s) in metabolomics studies where the numbers of variables often far exceed the number of samples. In addition, these alternative techniques may be useful tools for generating parsimonious models through feature selection and data reduction, as well as providing more propitious results. We sincerely hope that the general reader is left with little doubt that there are several promising and readily available alternatives to PLS-DA, to analyze large and highly complex data sets.},

abstract = {Light is a powerful tool for manipulating living cells because it can be applied with high resolution across space and over time. We previously constructed a red light-sensitive Escherichia coli transcription system based on a chimera between the red/far-red switchable cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 and the E. coli EnvZ/OmpR two-component signaling pathway. Here, we report the development of a green light-inducible transcription system in E. coli based on a recently discovered green/red photoswitchable two-component system from cyanobacteria. We demonstrate that the transcriptional output is proportional to the intensity of green light applied and that the green sensor is orthogonal to the red sensor at intensities of 532-nm light less than 0.01 W/m(2). Expression of both sensors in a single cell allows two-color optical control of transcription both in batch culture and in patterns across a lawn of engineered cells. Because each sensor functions as a photoreversible switch, this system should allow the spatial and temporal control of the expression of multiple genes through different combinations of light wavelengths.

abstract = {With the invention of electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, scientists employing modern mass spectrometry naturally face new challenges with respect to background interferences and contaminants that might not play a significant role in traditional or other analytical techniques. Efforts to continuously minimize sample volumes and measurable concentrations increase the need to understand where these interferences come from, how they can be identified, and if they can be eliminated. Knowledge of identity enables their use as internal calibrants for accurate mass measurements. This review/tutorial summarizes current literature on reported contaminants and introduces a number of novel interferences that have been observed and identified in our laboratories over the past decade. These include both compounds of proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous nature. In the supplemental data a spreadsheet is provided that contains a searchable ion list of all compounds identified to date. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {PURPOSE. Visual (retinoid) cycle anomalies induce aberrant build-up of all-trans retinal (atRAL) in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which is a cause of RPE atrophy in Stargardt disease type 1 and age-related macular degeneration. NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation is implicated in the etiology of age-related macular degeneration. Here, we elucidated the relationship between NLRP3 inflammasome activation and atRALinduced death of RPE cells. METHODS. Cellular toxicities were assessed by MTS or MTT assays. Expression levels of mRNAs and proteins were determined by quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fluorescence microscopy was used to examine intracellular signals. Ultrastructural features of organelles were examined by transmission electron microscope. RESULTS. Abnormal accumulation of atRAL was associated with a significant increase in the proportion of human ARPE-19 cells exhibiting features of apoptosis and Caspase-3/gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis. These cells also exhibited elevated expression of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved Caspase-1/poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)/Caspase-3/GSDME, interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$), and IL-18, as well as NLRP3 inflammasome-related genes (IL1B and IL18). After exposure of human ARPE-19 cells to excess atRAL, reactive oxygen species (ROS) (including mitochondrial ROS) and cathepsins released from lysosomes transmitted signals leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Suppressing the production of ROS, NLRP3 inflammasome, Caspase-1, cathepsin B, or cathepsin D protected ARPE-19 cells against atRAL-associated cytotoxicity. Damage to mitochondria, lysosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum in atRAL-exposed ARPE-19 cells was partially alleviated by treatment with MCC950, a selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS. Aberrant build-up of atRAL promotes the death of RPE cells via NLRP3 inflammasome activation.},

These degenerate peaks complicate spectral interpretation and are challenging to annotate. In mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, this degeneracy leads to inflated false discovery rates, data sets containing an order of magnitude more features than analytes, and an inefficient use of resources during data analysis. Although software has been introduced to annotate spectral degeneracy, current approaches are unable to represent several important classes of peak relationships. These include heterodimers and higher complex adducts, distal fragments, relationships between peaks in different polarities, and complex adducts between features and background peaks. Here we outline sources of peak degeneracy in mass spectra that are not annotated by current approaches and introduce a software package called mz.unity to detect these relationships in accurate mass data. Using mz.unity, we find that data ...},

abstract = {Prokaryotic Argonaute proteins acquire guide strands derived from invading or mobile genetic elements, via an unknown pathway, to direct guide-dependent cleavage of foreign DNA. Here, we report that Argonaute from the archaeal organism Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjAgo) possesses two modes of action: the canonical guide-dependent endonuclease activity and a non-guided DNA endonuclease activity. The latter allows MjAgo to process long double-stranded DNAs, including circular plasmid DNAs and genomic DNAs. Degradation of substrates in a guide-independent fashion primes MjAgo for subsequent rounds of DNA cleavage. Chromatinized genomic DNA is resistant to MjAgo degradation, and recombinant histones protect DNA from cleavage in vitro. Mutational analysis shows that key residues important for guide-dependent target processing are also involved in guide-independent MjAgo function. This is the first characterization of guide-independent cleavage activity for an Argonaute protein potentially serving as a guide biogenesis pathway in a prokaryotic system. A rgonaute (Ago) proteins are crucially involved in RNA-guided or DNA-guided degradation of target nucleic acids 1–3 . Present in all three domains of life, they bind guide strands in vivo to target complementary nucleic acids. Eukaryotic Agos interact with cytoplasmic RNA substrates 18–23 bp in length 4–6 , while prokaryotic Agos (pAgos) bind and process a variety of DNA and RNA substrates 7–11 . Among them, Agos from the archaeal organisms Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjAgo), Pyrococcus furiosus (PfAgo) and Natronobacterium gregoryi (NgAgo) are the only Ago variants that exclusively cleave DNA sub-strates using a DNA guide in vitro 7,11–13 . Guide recognition is mediated by a phosphate group at the 5′ end of the guide, which is coordinated in the Mid domain by conserved amino-acid side-chain interactions 14–18 . One exception comprises the recently characterized bacterial Agos from Marinitoga piezophila (MpAgo) and Thermotoga profunda (TpAgo), which recognize RNA guides with a 5′-hydroxyl group 19 . Loaded with the guide, Ago binds par-tially or fully complementary target nucleic acids via Watson–Crick base pairing. Only fully complementary target strands are cleaved by Ago. The catalytic site resides in the PIWI domain. Notably, numer-ous pAgos, especially short Ago variants, have an incomplete cata-lytic site, rendering them inactive 2},

Objective: To determine the effects of high fructose intake on plasma metabolomics. Study design: We enrolled 12 healthy volunteers (six lean and six obese women, age 24–35 years) in a crossover intervention study. All participants carried out three diets: (1) low fructose ({\textless}10 g/day); (2) high fructose (100 g/day) from natural food sources (fruit); and (3) high fructose (100 g/day) from high fructose syrup (HFS). Outcome measures: The primary outcome was changes in plasma metabolites measured by targeted metabolomics. Results: High compared to low fructose diets caused a marked metabolite class separation, especially because of changes in acylcarnitine and lysophosphatidylcholine levels. Both high fructose diets resulted in a decrease in mean acylcarnitine levels in all subjects, and an increase in mean lysophosphatidylcholine and diacyl-phosphatidylcholine levels in obese individuals. Medium chain acylcarnitines were negatively correlated with serum levels of liver enzymes and with the fatty liver index. Discussion: The metabolic shifts induced by high fructose consumption suggest an inhibition of mitochondrial $\beta$-oxidation and an increase in lipid peroxidation. The effects tended to be more pronounced following the HFS than the fruit diet.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We describe compartmentalized self-replication (CSR), a strategy for the directed evolution of enzymes, especially polymerases. CSR is based on a simple feedback loop consisting of a polymerase that replicates only its own encoding gene. Compartmentalization serves to isolate individual self-replication reactions from each other. In such a system, adaptive gains directly (and proportionally) translate into genetic amplification of the encoding gene. CSR has applications in the evolution of polymerases with novel and useful properties. By using three cycles of CSR, we obtained variants of Taq DNA polymerase with 11-fold higher thermostability than the wild-type enzyme or with a {\textgreater}130-fold increased resistance to the potent inhibitor heparin. Insertion of an extra stage into the CSR cycle before the polymerase reaction allows its application to enzymes other than polymerases. We show that nucleoside diphosphate kinase and Taq polymerase can form such a cooperative CSR cycle based on reciprocal catalysis, whereby nucleoside diphosphate kinase produces the substrates required for the replication of its own gene. We also find that in CSR the polymerase genes themselves evolve toward more efficient replication. Thus, polymerase genes and their encoded polypeptides cooperate to maximize postselection copy number. CSR should prove useful for the directed evolution of enzymes, particularly DNA or RNA polymerases, as well as for the design and study of in vitro self-replicating systems mimicking prebiotic evolution and viral replication.},

abstract = {Importance: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial disease with genetic and environmental factors contributing to risk. Histopathologic changes underlying AMD are not fully understood, particularly the relationship between choriocapillaris (CC) dysfunction and phenotypic variability of this disease. Objective: To examine histopathologic changes in the CC of eyes with clinically documented AMD. Design, Setting, and Participants: The studywas designed in 2011. Tissueswere collected post mortem (2012-2016), and histopathological images were obtained from participants enrolled in AMD studies since 1988. Clinical records and images were collected from participants as standard protocol. Eyes without AMD (n = 4) and eyes with early (n = 9), intermediate (n = 5), and advanced stages of AMD (geographic atrophy, n = 5; neovascular disease, n = 13) were evaluated. Choroidal vasculature was labeled using Ulex europaeus agglutinin lectin and examined using confocal microscopy. Main Outcomes and Measures: A standardized classification systemwas applied to determine AMD stage. Ocular records and images were reviewed and histopathologic analyses performed. Viability of the choroidal vasculature was analyzed for each AMD stage. Results: All participants were white. Fourteen were male, and 16 were female. The mean age was 90.5 years among AMD patients and 88.5 years among control participants. Submacular CC dropout without retinal pigment eipthelial (RPE) loss was observed in all cases with early stages of AMD. Higher vascular area loss for each AMD stage was observed compared with control participants: 20.5{\%}in early AMD (95{\%}CI, 11.2{\%}-40.2{\%}; P {\textless} .001), 12.5{\%}in intermediate AMD (95{\%}CI, 2.9{\%}-21.4{\%}; P = .01), 39.0{\%}loss in GA (95{\%}CI, 32.1{\%}-45.4{\%}; P {\textless} .001), and 38.2{\%}loss in neovascular disease where RPE remained intact (95{\%}CI, 27.7{\%}-47.9{\%}; P {\textless} .001). Hypercellular, apparent neovascular buds were adjacent to areas of CC loss in 22.2{\%}of eyes with early AMD and 40{\%} of eyes with intermediate AMD. Conclusions and Relevance: Retinal pigment epithelial atrophy preceded CC loss in geographic atrophy, but CC loss occurred in the absence of RPE atrophy in 2 of 9 eyes with early-stage AMD. Given the cross-sectional nature of this study and the small number of eyes evaluated, definitive conclusions regarding this progression cannot be determined with certainty. We speculate that neovascular buds may be a precursor to neovascular disease. Hypoxic RPE resulting from reduced blood supply might upregulate production of vascular endothelial growth factor, providing the stimulus for neovascular disease.},

We focus on the analysis of water-soluble primary metabolites, which carry the majority of metabolic flux in living organisms. We show how seemingly straightforward sample preparation methods can introduce systematic errors (e.g., due to interconversion among metabolites) and how proper selection of quenching solvent (e.g. acidic acetonitrile: methanol: water) can mitigate such problems.

abstract = {Here, we review the GraFix (Gradient Fixation) method to purify and stabilize macromolecular complexes for single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). During GraFix, macromolecules undergo a weak, intramolecular chemical cross-linking while being purified by density gradient ultracentrifugation. GraFix-stabilized particles can be used directly for negative-stain cryo-EM or, after a brief buffer-exchange step, for unstained cryo-EM. This highly reproducible method has proved to dramatically reduce problems in heterogeneity due to particle dissociation during EM grid preparation. Additionally, there is often an appreciable increase in particles binding to the carbon support film. This and the fact that binding times can be drastically increased, with no apparent disruption of the native structures of the macromolecules, makes GraFix a method of choice when preparing low-abundance complexes for cryo-EM. The higher sample quality following GraFix purification is evident when examining raw images, which usually present a low background of fragmented particles, good particle dispersion, and high-contrast, well-defined particles. Setting up the GraFix method is straightforward, and the resulting improvement in sample homogeneity has been beneficial in successfully obtaining the 3D structures of numerous macromolecular complexes by cryo-EM in the past few years. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The human retina is a complex tissue responsible for detecting photons of light and converting information from these photons into the neurochemical signals interpreted as vision. Such visual signaling not only requires sophisticated interactions between multiple classes of neurons, but also spatially-dependent molecular specialization of individual cell types. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on neural retina isolated from both the fovea and peripheral retina in three human donors. We recovered a total of 8,217 cells, with 3,578 cells originating from the fovea and 4,639 cells originating from the periphery. Expression profiles for all major retinal cell types were compiled, and differential expression analysis was performed between cells of foveal versus peripheral origin. Globally, mRNA for the serum iron binding protein transferrin (TF), which has been associated with age-related macular degeneration pathogenesis, was enriched in peripheral samples. Cone photoreceptor cells were of particular interest and formed two predominant clusters based on gene expression. One cone cluster had 96{\%} of cells originating from foveal samples, while the second cone cluster consisted exclusively of peripherally isolated cells. A total of 148 genes were differentially expressed between cones from the fovea versus periphery. Interestingly, peripheral cones were enriched for the gene encoding Beta-Carotene Oxygenase 2 (BCO2). A relative deficiency of this enzyme may account for the accumulation of carotenoids responsible for yellow pigment deposition within the macula. Overall, this data set provides rich expression profiles of the major human retinal cell types and highlights transcriptomic features that distinguish foveal and peripheral cells.},

abstract = {Geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that leads to progressive and irreversible loss of visual function. Geographic atrophy is defined by the presence of sharply demarcated atrophic lesions of the outer retina, resulting from loss of photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and underlying choriocapillaris. These lesions typically appear first in the perifoveal macula, initially sparing the foveal center, and over time often expand and coalesce to include the fovea. Although the kinetics of GA progression are highly variable among individual patients, a growing body of evidence suggests that specific characteristics may be important in predicting disease progression and outcomes. This review synthesizes current understanding of GA progression in AMD and the factors known or postulated to be relevant to GA lesion enlargement, including both affected and fellow eye characteristics. In addition, the roles of genetic, environmental, and demographic factors in GA lesion enlargement are discussed. Overall, GA progression rates reported in the literature for total study populations range from 0.53 to 2.6 mm2/year (median, ∼1.78 mm2/year), assessed primarily by color fundus photography or fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging. Several factors that could inform an individual's disease prognosis have been replicated in multiple cohorts: baseline lesion size, lesion location, multifocality, FAF patterns, and fellow eye status. Because best-corrected visual acuity does not correspond directly to GA lesion enlargement due to possible foveal sparing, alternative assessments are being explored to capture the relationship between anatomic progression and visual function decline, including microperimetry, low-luminance visual acuity, reading speed assessments, and patient-reported outcomes. Understanding GA progression and its individual variability is critical in the design of clinical studies, in the interpretation and application of clinical trial results, and for counseling patients on how disease progression may affect their individual prognosis.},

abstract = {The molecular regulators that orchestrate stem cell renewal, proliferation and differentiation along the mammary epithelial hierarchy remain poorly understood. Here we have performed a large-scale pooled RNAi screen in primary mouse mammary stem cell (MaSC)-enriched basal cells using 1295 shRNAs against genes principally involved in transcriptional regulation. MaSC-enriched basal cells transduced with lentivirus pools carrying shRNAs were maintained as non-adherent mammospheres, a system known to support stem and progenitor cells. Integrated shRNAs that altered culture kinetics were identified by next generation sequencing as relative frequency changes over time. RNA-seq-based expression profiling coupled with in vitro progenitor and in vivo transplantation assays was used to confirm a role for candidate genes in mammary stem and/or progenitor cells. Utilizing a mammosphere-based assay, the screen identified several candidate regulators. Although some genes had been previously implicated in mammary gland development, the vast majority of genes uncovered have no known function within the mammary gland. RNA-seq analysis of freshly purified primary mammary epithelial populations and short-term cultured mammospheres was used to confirm the expression of candidate regulators. Two genes, Asap1 and Prox1, respectively implicated in breast cancer metastasis and progenitor cell function in other systems, were selected for further analysis as their roles in the normal mammary gland were unknown. Both Prox1 and Asap1 were shown to act as negative regulators of progenitor activity in vitro, and Asap1 knock-down led to a marked increase in repopulating activity in vivo, implying a role in stem cell activity. This study has revealed a number of novel genes that influence the activity or survival of mammary stem and/or progenitor cells. Amongst these, we demonstrate that Prox1 and Asap1 behave as negative regulators of mammary stem/progenitor function. Both of these genes have also been implicated in oncogenesis. Our findings provide proof of principle for the use of short-term cultured primary MaSC/basal cells in functional RNAi screens.},

abstract = {Advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (LC-MS) instruments and analytical strategies have brought about great progress in targeted metabolomics analysis. This methodology is now capable of performing precise targeted measurement of dozens or hundreds of metabolites in complex biologic samples. Classic targeted quantification assay using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode has been the foundation of high-quality metabolite quantitation. However, utilization of this strategy in biologic studies has been limited by its relatively low metabolite coverage and throughput capacity. A number of methods for large-scale targeted metabolomics assay which have been developed overcome these limitations. These strategies have enabled extended metabolite coverage which is defined as targeting of large numbers of metabolites, while maintaining reliable quantification performance. These recently developed techniques thus bridge the gap between traditional targeted metabolite quantification and untargeted metabolomics profiling, and have proven to be powerful tools for metabolomics study. Although LC-MRM-MS strategy has been used widely in large-scale metabolomics quantification analysis due to its fast scan speed and ideal analytic stability, there are still drawbacks which are due to the low resolution of the triple quadrupole instruments used for MRM assays. New approaches have been developed to expand options for large-scale targeted metabolomics study, using high-resolution instruments such as parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). MRM and PRM-based techniques are now attractive strategies for quantitative metabolomics analysis and high-throughput biomarker discovery. Here we provide an overview of major developments in LC-MS-based strategies for large-scale targeted metabolomics quantification in biologic samples. The advantages of LC-MRM/PRM-MS based analytical strategies which may be used in multiplexed and high throughput quantitation for a wide range of metabolites are highlighted. In particular, PRM and MRM strategies are compared, and we summarize the work flow commonly used for large-scale targeted metabolomics analysis including sample preparation, LC separation and data analysis, as well as recent applications in biologic study.},

abstract = {While there have been significant advances in capturing data from the entities across complex real-world systems, their associations and relationships are largely unknown. Associations between the entities may reveal interesting system-level properties that may not be apparent otherwise. Often these associations are hypothesized by superimposing knowledge across distinct reductionist representations of these entities obtained from disparate sources. Such representations, while useful, may provide only an incomplete picture of the associations. This can be attributed to their dependence on prior knowledge and failure of the principle of superposition in general. Such representations may also be unhelpful in discovering novel undocumented associations. A more rigorous approach would be to identify associations from data measured simultaneously across the entities of interest from a given system. These data sets or digital signatures are quantized in time and amplitude and in turn may (dynamic) or may not (static) contain explicit temporal information. Symmetric measures such as correlation have been helpful in modeling direct associations as undirected graphs. However, it is well appreciated that the association between a given pair of entities may be indirect and often mediated through others. Symmetric measures are also immune to the direction of association by their very definition. Graphical models such as Bayesian networks have especially proven to be useful in this regard. The vertices (nodes) represent the entities of interest, the arcs (edges) represent their associations, and the entire Bayesian network represents the joint probability distribution between the entities of interest. Bayesian networks networks. It introduces the reader to structure and parameter learning from multiple independent realizations of data sets without explicit temporal information. Such data sets are quite common and represent a snapshot of the process. The impact of discretization on the network inference with application to molecular expression data is also discussed. The lack of temporal information implicitly excludes the presence of feedback or cycles, resulting in a directed acyclic graphical representation of the associations between the entities. These limitations are overcome by learning networks from data sets with explicit temporal signatures. In Chap. 3, we discuss the usefulness of dynamic Bayesian networks for learning the network structure in the presence of explicit temporal information such as multivariate time series. Homogeneous and nonhomogeneous dynamic Bayesian networks are discussed. In Chap. 4, static and dynamic Bayesian network inference methods are discussed. Some of the network learning algorithms discussed in the earlier chapters are computationally intensive limiting their usefulness across large and high-dimensional data sets. Parallelization options for some of the algorithms discussed in the earlier chapters are discussed in Chap. 5 to overcome some of these limitations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Alternative splicing (AS) is a posttranscriptional process that produces differ-ent transcripts from the same gene and is important to produce diverse protein products in response to environmental stimuli. AS occurs at specific sites on the mRNA sequence, some of which have been de-fined. Multiple bioinformatics tools have been developed to detect AS from experimental data. OBJECTIVES The goal of this review is to help researchers use specific tools to aid their research and to develop new AS detection tools based on these previously established tools. METHOD We selected 15 AS detection tools that were recently published; we classified and delineated them on several aspects. Also, a performance comparison of these tools with the same starting input was conducted. RESULT We reviewed the following categorized features of the tools: Publication information, working principles, generic and distinct workflows, running platform, input data requirement, sequencing depth dependency, reads mapped to multiple locations, isoform annotation basis, precise detected AS types, and performance benchmarks. CONCLUSION Through comparisons of these tools, we provide a panorama of the advantages and short-comings of each tool and their scopes of application.},

@article{Gao2019,
abstract = {Background: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial chronic disease of the eye. Several candidate pathways have been hypothesized to play a role in AMD pathogenesis. Our work and those of others suggests inflammasome activity as a mechanism associated with retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell demise. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), an anti-apoptosis factor, has recently been shown to regulate inflammasome activity in non-ocular cells. The purpose of this study is to characterize XIAP's regulatory role in RPE. Methods: Protein lysates of eye tissues from rats (vinpocetine- or aurin tricarboxylic acid complex-treated, ATAC, vs na{\"{i}}ve) and mice (wild type vs Caspase-4 -/- ) were utilized to analyze XIAP protein levels. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect NLRP3 levels in the RPE layer. In vitro inflammasome activation on RPE cells was achieved with L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (Leu-Leu-OMe) stimulation. Levels of XIAP mRNA and 18S RNA were quantified by RT-PCR. Cell culture supernatants were tested directly for secreted IL-1$\beta$ by ELISA or concentrated for the detection of secreted IL-18 by western blot. Protein lysates from RPE in cell culture were collected for the measurement of cleaved caspase-1 p20, XIAP, and GAPDH. Data are presented as Mean ± SD. p {\textless} 0.05 is considered statistically significant. Results: The XIAP protein level was significantly increased when the inflammasome was inhibited at the "activation" step by ATAC, but not the "priming" step, in vivo. Concomitantly, NLRP3 immunoreactivity was lower in the RPE layer of animals fed with ATAC. In mice where caspase-1 cleavage was impaired by the genetic deficiency in caspase-4, the XIAP protein level increased in eye tissues. In RPE cell culture, Leu-Leu-OMe stimulation led to caspase-1 cleavage, cytokine secretion, and XIAP reduction, which can be abolished by Z-YVAD-FMK. When XIAP siRNA was given as a pre-treatment to RPE in vitro, Leu-Leu-OMe induced IL-1$\beta$/IL-18 secretion was enhanced, whereas overexpressing XIAP reduced IL-1$\beta$ secretion under inflammasome activation, both compared to controls cells. Conclusions: Together, these data suggest XIAP-mediated inhibition of inflammasome activity in RPE may provide insights into the biological consequences of inflammasome activation in RPE and reveals the caspase-1/XIAP/IL-1$\beta$/IL-18 axis as a target for broader applications in AMD biology and treatment design.},

abstract = {Enzymes regulate biological processes through the conversion of specific substrates to products. Therefore, of fundamental interest for every enzyme is the elucidation of its natural substrates. Here, we describe a general strategy for identifying endogenous substrates of enzymes by untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of tissue metabolomes from wild-type and enzyme-inactivated organisms. We use this method to discover several brain lipids regulated by the mammalian enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in vivo, including known signaling molecules (e.g., the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide) and a novel family of nervous system-enriched natural products, the taurine-conjugated fatty acids. Remarkably, the relative hydrolytic activity that FAAH exhibited for lipid metabolites in vitro was not predictive of the identity of specific FAAH substrates in vivo. Thus, global metabolite profiling establishes unanticipated connections between the proteome and metabolome that enable assignment of an enzyme's unique biochemical functions in vivo.},

abstract = {Argonaute can be found in all three domains of life and is the functional core of the eukaryotic RNA-silencing machinery. In order to shed light on the conformational changes that drive Argonaute action, we performed single-molecule FRET measurements employing a so far uncharacterized member of the Argonaute family, namely Argonaute from the archaeal organism Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjAgo). We show that MjAgo is a catalytically active Argonaute variant hydrolyzing exclusively DNA target strands out of a DNA/DNA hybrid. We studied the interplay between Argonaute and nucleic acids using fluorescent dyes covalently attached at different positions of the DNA guide as steric reporters. This allowed us to determine structurally confined parts of the protein scaffold and flexible regions of the DNA guide. Single-molecule FRET measurements demonstrate that the 3'end of the DNA guide is released from the PAZ domain upon target strand loading. This conformational change does not necessitate target strand cleavage but a fully complementary target strand. Thus, our data support the two state model for Argonaute action.},

abstract = {The human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid are complex tissues that provide crucial support to the retina. Disease affecting either of these supportive tissues can lead to irreversible blindness in the setting of age-related macular degeneration. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on macular and peripheral regions of RPE-choroid from 7 human donor eyes in 2 independent experiments. In the first experiment, total RPE/ choroid preparations were evaluated and expression profiles specific to RPE and major choroidal cell populations were identified. As choroidal endothelial cells represent a minority of the total RPE/ choroidal cell population but are strongly implicated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) pathogenesis, a second single-cell RNA-sequencing experiment was performed using endothelial cells enriched by magnetic separation. In this second study, we identified gene expression signatures along the choroidal vascular tree, classifying the transcriptome of human choriocapillaris, arterial, and venous endothelial cells. We found that the choriocapillaris highly and specifically expresses the regulator of cell cycle gene (RGCC), a gene that responds to complement activation and induces apoptosis in endothelial cells. In addition, RGCC was the most up-regulated choriocapillaris gene in a donor diagnosed with AMD. These results provide a characterization of the human RPE and choriocapillaris transcriptome, offering potential insight into the mechanisms of choriocapillaris response to complement injury and choroidal vascular disease in age-related macular degeneration.},

All RNA interference pathways use small single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) molecules that guide proteins of the Argonaute (Ago) family to complementary ssRNA targets: RNA-guided RNA interference. The role of prokaryotic Ago variants has remained elusive, although bioinformatics analysis has suggested their involvement in host defence. Here we demonstrate that Ago of the bacterium Thermus thermophilus (TtAgo) acts as a barrier for the uptake and propagation of foreign DNA. In vivo, TtAgo is loaded with 5'-phosphorylated DNA guides, 13-25 nucleotides in length, that are mostly plasmid derived and have a strong bias for a 5'-end deoxycytidine. These small interfering DNAs guide TtAgo to cleave complementary DNA strands. Hence, despite structural homology to its eukaryotic counterparts, TtAgo functions in host defence by DNA-guided DNA interference.},

We detect very few differentially expressed genes between male and female immune cells except in macrophages from three different tissues. Accordingly, very few genomic regions display differences in accessibility between sexes. Transcriptional sexual dimorphism in macrophages is mediated by genes of innate immune pathways, and increases after interferon stimulation.

We implemented a quantitative polar metabolomics profiling platform using selected reaction monitoring with a 5500 QTRAP hybrid triple quadrupole mass spectrometer that covers all major metabolic pathways. The platform uses hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with positive/negative ion switching to analyze 258 metabolites (289 Q1/Q3 transitions) from a single 15-min liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry acquisition with a 3-ms dwell time and a 1.55-s duty cycle time. Previous platforms use more than one experiment to profile this number of metabolites from different ionization modes. The platform is compatible with polar metabolites from any biological source, including fresh tissues, cancer cells, bodily fluids and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. Relative quantification can be achieved without using internal standards, and integrated peak areas based on total ion current can be used for statistical analyses and pathway analyses across biological sample conditions. The procedure takes approximately 12 h from metabolite extraction to peak integration for a data set containing 15 total samples ( approximately 6 h for a single sample).},

Here, we examine piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) associated with each Drosophila Piwi protein and find that Piwi and Aubergine bind RNAs that are predominantly antisense to transposons, whereas Ago3 complexes contain predominantly sense piRNAs. As in mammals, the majority of Drosophila piRNAs are derived from discrete genomic loci. These loci comprise mainly defective transposon sequences, and some have previously been identified as master regulators of transposon activity. Our data suggest that heterochromatic piRNA loci interact with potentially active, euchromatic transposons to form an adaptive system for transposon control. Complementary relationships between sense and antisense piRNA populations suggest an amplification loop wherein each piRNA-directed cleavage event generates the 5′ end of a new piRNA. Thus, sense piRNAs, formed following cleavage of transposon mRNAs may enhance production of antisense piRNAs, complementary to active elements, by directing cleavage of transcripts from master control loci. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are essential components of the cancer microenvironment and play critical roles in the regulation of tumor progression. Optimal therapeutic intervention requires in-depth understanding of the sources that sustain macrophages in malignant tissues. In this study, we investigated the ontogeny of TAMs in murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models. We identified both inflammatory monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages as sources of TAMs. Unexpectedly, significant portions of pancreas-resident macrophages originated from embryonic development and expanded through in situ proliferation during tumor progression. Whereas monocyte-derived TAMs played more potent roles in antigen presentation, embryonically derived TAMs exhibited a pro-fibrotic transcriptional profile, indicative of their role in producing and remodeling molecules in the extracellular matrix. Collectively, these findings uncover the heterogeneity of TAM origin and functions and could provide therapeutic insight for PDAC treatment.},

abstract = {Argonaute proteins (Agos) are present in all domains of life. Although the physiological function of eukaryotic Agos in regulating gene expression is well documented, the biological roles of many of their prokaryotic counterparts remain enigmatic. In some bacteria, Agos are associated with CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) loci and use noncanonical 5'-hydroxylated guide RNAs (gRNAs) for nucleic acid targeting. Here we show that using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) as the 5' nucleotide of gRNAs stabilizes in vitro reconstituted CRISPR-associatedMarinitoga piezophilaArgonaute-gRNA complexes (MpAgo RNPs) and significantly improves their specificity and affinity for RNA targets. Using reconstituted MpAgo RNPs with 5'-BrdU-modified gRNAs, we mapped the seed region of the gRNA and identified the nucleotides of the gRNA that play the most significant role in targeting specificity. We also show that these MpAgo RNPs can be programmed to distinguish between substrates that differ by a single nucleotide, using permutations at the sixth and seventh positions in the gRNA. Using these specificity features, we employed MpAgo RNPs to detect specific adenosine-to-inosine-edited RNAs in a complex mixture. These findings broaden our mechanistic understanding of the interactions of Argonautes with guide and substrate RNAs, and demonstrate that MpAgo RNPs with 5'-BrdU-modified gRNAs can be used as a highly specific RNA-targeting platform to probe RNA biology.},

Here, we identify a myeloid-derived mucosal DC in mice, which populates the entire lamina propria of the small intestine.

CX3CR1 was also found to control the clearance of entero-invasive pathogens by DCs. Thus, CX 3CR1-dependent processes, which control host interactions of specialized DCs with commensal and pathogenic bacteria, may regulate immunological tolerance and inflammation.},

However, it has been challenging to identify the cell types associated with AMD given the genetic complexity of the disease. Here we perform massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of human retinas using two independent platforms, and report the first single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human retina. Using a multi-resolution network-based analysis, we identify all major retinal cell types, and their corresponding gene expression signatures. Heterogeneity is observed within macroglia, suggesting that human retinal glia are more diverse than previously thought. Finally, GWAS-based enrichment analysis identifies glia, vascular cells, and cone photoreceptors to be associated with the risk of AMD. These data provide a detailed analysis of the human retina, and show how scRNA-seq can provide insight into cell types involved in complex, inflammatory genetic diseases.},

The glomerular endothelium, which is highly fenestrated and covered by a rich glycocalyx, participates in the sieving properties of the glomerular filtration barrier and in the maintenance of podocyte structure. The microvascular endothelium in peritubular capillaries, which is also fenestrated, transports reabsorbed components and participates in epithelial cell function. The endothelium of large and small vessels supports the renal vasculature. These renal endothelia are protected by regulators of thrombosis, inflammation and complement, but endothelial injury (for example, induced by toxins, antibodies, immune cells or inflammatory cytokines) or defects in factors that provide endothelial protection (for example, regulators of complement or angiogenesis) can lead to acute or chronic renal injury. Moreover, renal endothelial cells can transition towards a mesenchymal phenotype, favouring renal fibrosis and the development of chronic kidney disease. Thus, the renal endothelium is both a target and a driver of kidney and systemic cardiovascular complications. Emerging therapeutic strategies that target the renal endothelium may lead to improved outcomes for both rare and common renal diseases.},

We validated the classification scheme and identified dozens of novel markers using methods that match molecular expression to cell morphology.

From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

Although metabolites are frequently modified, these modifications have not been studied using -omics approaches. Here a general strategy for the nontargeted profiling of modified metabolites, which we call "nontargeted modification-specific metabolomics", is reported. A key aspect of this strategy was the combination of in-source collision-induced dissociation liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and global nontargeted LC-MS-based metabolomics. Characteristic neutral loss fragments that are specific for acetylation, sulfation, glucuronidation, glucosidation, or ribose conjugation were reproducibly detected using human urine as a model specimen for method development. The practical application of this method was demonstrated by profiling urine samples from liver cirrhosis patients. Approximately 900 features were identified as modified endogenous metabolites and xenobiotics. Moreover, this strategy supports the identification of compounds not included in traditional metabolomics databases (HMDB, Metlin, and KEGG), which are currently referred to as "unknowns" in metabolomics projects. Nontargeted modification-specific metabolomics opens a new perspective in systems biology.},

abstract = {Image-based approaches to single-cell transcriptomics, in which RNA species are identified and counted in situ via imaging, have emerged as a powerful complement to single-cell methods based on RNA sequencing of dissociated cells. These image-based approaches naturally preserve the native spatial context of RNAs within a cell and the organization of cells within tissue, which are important for addressing many biological questions. However, the throughput of these image-based approaches is relatively low. Here we report advances that lead to a drastic increase in the measurement throughput of multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), an image-based approach to single-cell transcriptomics. In MERFISH, RNAs are identified via a combinatorial labeling approach that encodes RNA species with error-robust barcodes followed by sequential rounds of single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to read out these barcodes. Here we increase the throughput of MERFISH by two orders of magnitude through a combination of improvements, including using chemical cleavage instead of photobleaching to remove fluorescent signals between consecutive rounds of smFISH imaging, increasing the imaging field of view, and using multicolor imaging. With these improvements, we performed RNA profiling in more than 100,000 human cells, with as many as 40,000 cells measured in a single 18-h measurement. This throughput should substantially extend the range of biological questions that can be addressed by MERFISH.},

The performance is notable when modeling H3 on a homology framework, where RosettaAntibody produced the best model among all participants for four of the 11 targets, two of which were predicted with sub-{\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m accuracy. To improve RosettaAntibody, we pursued the causes of model errors. The most common limitation was template unavailability, underscoring the need for more antibody structures and/or better de novo loop methods. In some cases, better templates could have been found by considering residues outside of the CDRs. De novo CDR H3 modeling remains challenging at long loop lengths, but constraining the C-terminal end of H3 to a kinked conformation allows near-native conformations to be sampled more frequently. We also found that incorrect VL -VH orientations caused models with low H3 RMSDs to score poorly, suggesting that correct VL -VH orientations will improve discrimination between near-native and incorrect conformations. These observations will guide the future development of RosettaAntibody. Proteins 2014; 82:1611-1623. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The RNA-induced silencing complex, comprising Argonaute and guide RNA, mediates RNA interference. Here we report the 3.2 {\AA} crystal structure of Kluyveromyces polysporus Argonaute (KpAGO) fortuitously complexed with guide RNA originating from small-RNA duplexes autonomously loaded by recombinant KpAGO. Despite their diverse sequences, guide-RNA nucleotides 1-8 are positioned similarly, with sequence-independent contacts to bases, phosphates and 2'-hydroxyl groups pre-organizing the backbone of nucleotides 2-8 in a near-A-form conformation. Compared with prokaryotic Argonautes, KpAGO has numerous surface-exposed insertion segments, with a cluster of conserved insertions repositioning the N domain to enable full propagation of guide-target pairing. Compared with Argonautes in inactive conformations, KpAGO has a hydrogen-bond network that stabilizes an expanded and repositioned loop, which inserts an invariant glutamate into the catalytic pocket. Mutation analyses and analogies to ribonuclease H indicate that insertion of this glutamate finger completes a universally conserved catalytic tetrad, thereby activating Argonaute for RNA cleavage.},

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {PURPOSE. To investigate variations in chorioretinal vasculatures in fellow eyes of patients with unilateral neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). METHODS. We included fellow eyes of consecutive patients with unilateral nAMD from swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) angiography database. Vascular and nonvascular indices were determined based on SS-OCT and SS-OCT angiography images. Variation of the vascular or nonvascular index was compared between fellow eyes with and without early AMD. RESULTS. In 146 fellow eyes, 88 (60.3{\%}) had early AMD and 58 (39.7{\%}) had a normal fundus. Vascular density (VD) values of the superficial and deep retinal capillary plexus and choriocapillaris were smaller in eyes with early AMD than in those without (P {\textless} 0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.006, respectively). Flow void area in choriocapillaris was greater in eyes with early AMD than those without (P = 0.015). In 88 fellow eyes with early AMD, vascular indices of the retina were correlated with those of choroid while nonvascular indices were not. Fellow eyes of patients with classic exudative AMD had greater foveal avascular zone area and smaller VD values of the deep retinal capillary plexus than those with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (P {\textless} 0.001, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS. In addition to vascular insufficiency in the choroid or choriocapillaris, retinal vascular alteration was apparent in eyes with early AMD. It may suggest that retinal vessels were involved in the pathogenesis of AMD even while changes in nonvascular components of the retina were not yet apparent.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Global gene expression profiles of bovine kidney epithelial cells regulated by sodium butyrate were investigated with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. The bovine microarray with 86,191 distinct 60mer oligonucleotides, each with 4 replicates, was designed and produced with Maskless Array Synthesizer technology. These oligonucleotides represent approximately 45,383 unique cattle sequences. RESULTS: 450 genes significantly regulated by butyrate with a median False Discovery Rate (FDR) = 0 {\%} were identified. The majority of these genes were repressed by butyrate and associated with cell cycle control. The expression levels of 30 selected genes identified by the microarray were confirmed using real-time PCR. The results from real-time PCR positively correlated (R = 0.867) with the results from the microarray. CONCLUSION: This study presented the genes related to multiple signal pathways such as cell cycle control and apoptosis. The profound changes in gene expression elucidate the molecular basis for the pleiotropic effects of butyrate on biological processes. These findings enable better recognition of the full range of beneficial roles butyrate may play during cattle energy metabolism, cell growth and proliferation, and possibly in fighting gastrointestinal pathogens.},

abstract = {SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) are ge-netic markers whose precise identification is a pre-requisite for association studies. Methods to iden-tify them are currently well developed for model species, but rely on the availability of a (good) reference genome, and therefore cannot be ap-plied to non-model species. They are also mostly tailored for whole genome (re-)sequencing experi-ments, whereas in many cases, transcriptome se-quencing can be used as a cheaper alternative which already enables to identify SNPs located in tran-scribed regions. In this paper, we propose a method that identifies, quantifies and annotates SNPs with-out any reference genome, using RNA-seq data only. Individuals can be pooled prior to sequencing, if not enough material is available from one individual. Us-ing pooled human RNA-seq data, we clarify the pre-cision and recall of our method and discuss them with respect to other methods which use a reference genome or an assembled transcriptome. We then val-idate experimentally the predictions of our method using RNA-seq data from two non-model species. The method can be used for any species to anno-tate SNPs and predict their impact on the protein se-quence. We further enable to test for the association of the identified SNPs with a phenotype of interest.},

We report the crystal structure of Aquifex aeolicus Ago (Aa-Ago) together with binding and cleavage studies, which establish this eubacterial Ago as a bona fide guide DNA strand-mediated site-specific RNA endonuclease. We have generated a stereochemically robust model of the complex, where the guide DNA-mRNA duplex is positioned within a basic channel spanning the bilobal interface, such that the 5′ phosphate of the guide strand can be anchored in a basic pocket, and the mRNA can be positioned for site-specific cleavage by RNase H-type divalent cation-coordinated catalytic Asp residues of the PIWI domain. Domain swap experiments involving chimeras of human Ago (hAgo1) and cleavage-competent hAgo2 reinforce the role of the PIWI domain in "slicer" activity. We propose a four-step Ago-mediated catalytic cleavage cycle model, which provides distinct perspectives into the mechanism of guide strand-mediated mRNA cleavage within the RISC.

Before statistical comparison, registration must be established to match corresponding analytes from run to run. Alignment, the most popular correspondence approach, consists of constructing a function that warps the content of runs to most closely match a given reference sample. To date, dozens of correspondence algorithms have been proposed, creating a daunting challenge for practitioners in algorithm selection. Yet, existing reviews have highlighted only a few approaches. In this review, we describe 50 correspondence algorithms to facilitate practical algorithm selection. We elucidate the motivation for correspondence and analyze the limitations of current approaches, which include prohibitive runtimes, numerous user parameters, model limitations and the need for reference samples. We suggest and describe a paradigm shift for overcoming current correspondence limitations by building on known liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry behavior.},

abstract = {RNAi has existed at least since the divergence of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This collection of pathways responds to a diversity of "abberant" RNAs and generally silences or eliminates genes sharing sequence content with the silencing trigger. In the canonical pathway, double-stranded RNAs are processed into small RNAs, which guide effector complexes to their targets by complementary base pairing. Many alternative routes from silencing trigger to small RNA are continuously being uncovered. Though the triggers of the pathway and the mechanisms of small RNA production are many, all RNAi-related mechanisms share Argonaute proteins as the heart of their effector complexes. These can act as self-contained silencing machines, binding directly to small RNAs, carrying out homology-based target recognition, and in some cases cleaving targets using an endogenous nuclease domain. Here, we discuss the diversity of Argonaute proteins from a structural and functional perspective.},

While measurements of choroid using optical coherence tomography show altered thickness in aging and macular disease, detailed histopathologic and proteomic analyses are lacking. In this study we sought to evaluate biochemical differences in human donor eyes between very thin and thick choroids. Methods. One hundred forty-one eyes from 104 donors (mean age ± standard deviation, 81.5 ± 12.2) were studied. Macular sections were collected, and the distance between Bruch's membrane and the inner surface of the sclera was measured in control, early/dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), neovascular AMD, and geographic atrophy eyes. Proteins from the RPE-choroid of eyes with thick and thin choroids were analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis and/or mass spectrometry. Two proteins with altered abundance were confirmed using Western blot analysis. Results. Donor eyes showed a normal distribution of thicknesses. Eyes with geographic atrophy had significantly thinner choroids than age-matched controls or early AMD eyes. Proteomic analysis showed higher levels of the serine protease SERPINA3 in thick choroids and increased levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP3) in thin choroids. Conclusions. Consistent with clinical imaging observations, geographic atrophy was associated with choroidal thinning. Biochemical data suggest an alteration in the balance between proteases and protease inhibitors in eyes that lie at the extremes of choroidal thickness. An improved understanding of the basic mechanisms associated with choroidal thinning may guide the development of new therapies for AMD. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Resident macrophages regulate homeostatic and disease processes in multiple tissues, including the kidney. Despite having well defined markers to identify these cells in mice, technical limitations have prevented identification of a similar cell type across species. The inability to identify resident macrophage populations across species hinders the translation of data obtained from animal model to human patients. METHODS As an entry point to determine novel markers that could identify resident macrophages across species, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis of all T and B cell-negative CD45+ innate immune cells in mouse, rat, pig, and human kidney tissue. RESULTS We identified genes with enriched expression in mouse renal resident macrophages that were also present in candidate resident macrophage populations across species. Using the scRNAseq data, we defined a novel set of possible cell surface markers (Cd74 and Cd81) for these candidate kidney resident macrophages. We confirmed, using parabiosis and flow cytometry, that these proteins are indeed enriched in mouse resident macrophages. Flow cytometry data also indicated the existence of a defined population of innate immune cells in rat and human kidney tissue that coexpress CD74 and CD81, suggesting the presence of renal resident macrophages in multiple species. CONCLUSIONS Based on transcriptional signatures, our data indicate that there is a conserved population of innate immune cells across multiple species that have been defined as resident macrophages in the mouse. Further, we identified potential cell surface markers to allow for future identification and characterization of this candidate resident macrophage population in mouse, rat, and pig translational studies.},

abstract = {When expression of more than one gene is required in cells, bicistronic or multicistronic expression vectors have been used. Among various strategies employed to construct bicistronic or multicistronic vectors, an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) has been widely used. Due to the large size and difference in expression levels between genes before and after IRES, however, a new strategy was required to replace IRES. A self-cleaving 2A peptide could be a good candidate to replace IRES because of its small size and high cleavage efficiency between genes upstream and downstream of the 2A peptide. Despite the advantages of the 2A peptides, its use is not widespread because (i) there are no publicly available cloning vectors harboring a 2A peptide gene and (ii) comprehensive comparison of cleavage efficiency among various 2A peptides reported to date has not been performed in different contexts. Here, we generated four expression plasmids each harboring different 2A peptides derived from the foot-and-mouth disease virus, equine rhinitis A virus, Thosea asigna virus and porcine teschovirus-1, respectively, and evaluated their cleavage efficiency in three commonly used human cell lines, zebrafish embryos and adult mice. Western blotting and confocal microscopic analyses revealed that among the four 2As, the one derived from porcine teschovirus-1 (P2A) has the highest cleavage efficiency in all the contexts examined. We anticipate that the 2A-harboring cloning vectors we generated and the highest efficiency of the P2A peptide we demonstrated would help biomedical researchers easily adopt the 2A technology when bicistronic or multicistronic expression is required.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic Argonautes bind small RNAs and use them as guides to find complementary RNA targets and induce gene silencing. Though homologs of eukaryotic Argonautes are present in many bacteria and archaea, their small RNA partners and functions are unknown. We found that the Argonaute of Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RsAgo) associates with 15-19 nt RNAs that correspond to the majority of transcripts. RsAgo also binds single-stranded 22-24 nt DNA molecules that are complementary to the small RNAs and enriched in sequences derived from exogenous plasmids as well as genome-encodedforeign nucleic acids such as transposons and phage genes. Expression of RsAgo in the heterologous E.coli system leads to formation of plasmid-derived small RNA and DNA and plasmid degradation. In a R.sphaeroides mutant lacking RsAgo, expression of plasmid-encoded genes is elevated. Our results indicate that RNAi-related processes found in eukaryotes are also conserved in bacteria and target foreign nucleic acids. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Recent genome-wide analyses have indicated that almost all primary transcripts from multi-exon human genes undergo alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS). Given the prevalence of AS and its importance in expanding proteomic complexity, a major challenge that lies ahead is to determine the functional specificity of isoforms in a cellular context. A significant fraction of alternatively spliced transcripts are regulated in a tissue- or cell-type-specific manner, suggesting that these mRNA variants likely function in the generation of cellular diversity. Complementary to these observations, several tissue-specific splicing factors have been identified, and a number of methodological advances have enabled the identification of large repertoires of target transcripts regulated by these proteins. An emerging theme is that tissue-specific splicing factors regulate coherent sets of splice variants in genes known to function in related biological pathways. This review focuses on the recent progress in our understanding of neural-specific splicing factors and their regulatory networks and outlines existing and emerging strategies for uncovering important biological roles for the isoforms that comprise these networks.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Often considered purely genomic parasites, transposons can also benefit their hosts, playing roles in gene regulation and in genome organization and evolution. Peaceful coexistence with mobile elements depends upon adaptive control mechanisms, since unchecked transposon activity can impact long-term fitness and acutely reduce the fertility of progeny. Here, we review the conserved roles played by small RNAs in the adaptation of eukaryotes to coexist with their genomic colonists.

However, Salmonella typhimurium that are deficient in invasion genes encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island I (SP11) are still able to reach the spleen after oral administration. This suggests the existence of an alternative route for bacterial invasion, one that is independent of M cells. We report here a new mechanism for bacterial uptake in the mucosa tissues that is mediated by dendritic cells (DCs). DCs open the tight junctions between epithelial cells, send dendrites outside the epithelium and directly sample bacteria. In addition, because DCs express tight-junction proteins such as occludin, claudin 1 and zonula occludens 1, the integrity of the epithelial barrier is preserved.},

Using ZipSeq, we mapped gene expression in three settings: in-vitro wound healing, live lymph node sections and in a live tumor microenvironment (TME). In all cases, we discovered new gene expression patterns associated with histological structures. In the TME, this demonstrated a trajectory of myeloid and T cell differentiation, from periphery inward.

This study was aimed to measure the concentrations of these elements in choroid-RPE and retina of human donor eyes with and without age-related macular degeneration associated changes. Human cadaver donor eyeballs were obtained from the CU Shah eye bank, Sankara Nethralaya Eye Hospital, India, after removal of the cornea. 39 control and 51 AMD donor eyes were used in this study. Alabama grading was done on the histopathological sections to identify early and late age-related macular degeneration changes. Concentrations of lead, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, nickel, arsenic and selenium were determined in choroid-RPE and retina using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS). Further, gene expression of oxidative stress-related genes, Nrf-2, HO-1, GCLC, GCLM, and detoxification related gene GSTpi was performed. The data were analyzed for statistical significance using Graph Pad{\textregistered} Prism 5 software. Donor eyes with early and late AMD had significantly higher levels of lead, cadmium, chromium, arsenic, and nickel in choroid-RPE and retina compared to the control eyes. Selenium was significantly increased in late AMD compared to control. No significant difference was observed in the levels of cobalt between eyes with and without AMD. Decreased transcript levels of oxidative stress-related genes were observed in the choroid-RPE and retinal tissues. Nrf-2 (p {\textless} 0.05), HO-1 and GCLC expressions were lowered in the retina of AMD, whereas GCLM and GSTpi expressions were decreased (p {\textless} 0.05) with an increase in HO-1 in choroid-RPE of AMD. This study provides evidence that alterations of the heavy metals and toxic elements along with oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of AMD.},

abstract = {Next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) maps and analyzes transcriptomes and generates data on sequence variation in expressed genes. There are few reported studies on analysis strategies to maximize the yield of quality RNA-seq SNP data. We evaluated the performance of different SNP-calling methods following alignment to both genome and transcriptome by applying them to RNA-seq data from a HapMap lymphoblastoid cell line sample and comparing results with sequence variation data from 1000 Genomes. We determined that the best method to achieve high specificity and sensitivity, and greatest number of SNP calls, is to remove duplicate sequence reads after alignment to the genome and to call SNPs using SAMtools. The accuracy of SNP calls is dependent on sequence coverage available. In terms of specificity, 89{\%} of RNA-seq SNPs calls were true variants where coverage is {\textgreater}10X. In terms of sensitivity, at {\textgreater}10X coverage 92{\%} of all expected SNPs in expressed exons could be detected. Overall, the results indicate that RNA-seq SNP data are a very useful by-product of sequence-based transcriptome analysis. If RNA-seq is applied to disease tissue samples and assuming that genes carrying mutations relevant to disease biology are being expressed, a very high proportion of these mutations can be detected.},

To evaluate the algorithms, we compared the annotation of CAMERA against a manually defined annotation for a mixture of known compounds spiked into a complex matrix at different concentrations. CAMERA successfully extracted accurate masses for 89.7{\%} and 90.3{\%} of the annotatable compounds in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Furthermore, we present a novel annotation approach that combines spectral information of data acquired in opposite ion modes to further improve the annotation rate.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Untargeted metabolomics generates a huge amount of data. Software packages for automated data processing are crucial to successfully process these data. A variety of such software packages exist, but the outcome of data processing strongly depends on algorithm parameter settings. If they are not carefully chosen, suboptimal parameter settings can easily lead to biased results. Therefore, parameter settings also require optimization. Several parameter optimization approaches have already been proposed, but a software package for parameter optimization which is free of intricate experimental labeling steps, fast and widely applicable is still missing.RESULTS:We implemented the software package IPO ('Isotopologue Parameter Optimization') which is fast and free of labeling steps, and applicable to data from different kinds of samples and data from different methods of liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry and data from different instruments.IPO optimizes XCMS peak picking parameters by using natural, stable 13C isotopic peaks to calculate a peak picking score. Retention time correction is optimized by minimizing relative retention time differences within peak groups. Grouping parameters are optimized by maximizing the number of peak groups that show one peak from each injection of a pooled sample. The different parameter settings are achieved by design of experiments, and the resulting scores are evaluated using response surface models. IPO was tested on three different data sets, each consisting of a training set and test set. IPO resulted in an increase of reliable groups (146{\%} - 361{\%}), a decrease of non-reliable groups (3{\%} - 8{\%}) and a decrease of the retention time deviation to one third.CONCLUSIONS:IPO was successfully applied to data derived from liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry from three studies with different sample types and different chromatographic methods and devices. We were also able to show the potential of IPO to increase the reliability of metabolomics data.The source code is implemented in R, tested on Linux and Windows and it is freely available for download at https://github.com/glibiseller/IPO webcite. The training sets and test sets can be downloaded from https://health.joanneum.at/IPO webcite.},

abstract = {The P2X7 receptor is a non-selective cation channel activated by extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Chronic activation of P2X7 underlies many health problems such as pathologic pain, yet we lack effective antagonists due to poorly understood mechanisms of inhibition. Here we present crystal structures of a mammalian P2X7 receptor complexed with five structurally-unrelated antagonists. Unexpectedly, these drugs all bind to an allosteric site distinct from the ATP-binding pocket in a groove formed between two neighboring subunits. This novel drug-binding pocket accommodates a diversity of small molecules mainly through hydrophobic interactions. Functional assays propose that these compounds allosterically prevent narrowing of the drug-binding pocket and the turret-like architecture during channel opening, which is consistent with a site of action distal to the ATP-binding pocket. These novel mechanistic insights will facilitate the development of P2X7-specific drugs for treating human diseases.},

abstract = {There is an increasing body of evidence as to the risk factors for age-related macular degeneration. Age and genetic make-up are the most important risk factors identified to date. Over the next decade, the different genes that are involved in the development of age-related macular degeneration will be identified. There is reasonably consistent evidence that smoking cigarettes results in increased risk of the disease. The question as to whether antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation prevents or delays the development of the disease will be resolved as the results of large ongoing trials become available in the next few years. Currently, there is conflicting evidence as to their benefits and some indication as to possible harm. Other risk factors such as alcohol consumption, oestrogen replacement and lifetime light exposure require further study. The study of the epidemiology of age-related macular degeneration would be facilitated by a greater standardization of methods. Studies with large numbers of late stage disease are needed in order to provide the power to investigate moderate risks. This may either be achieved by adding on macular degeneration studies to large cohort studies already in place, or by pooling data from smaller studies. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

We report chromatin accessibility profiles from more than 15,000 single cells and use these data to cluster cells on the basis of chromatin accessibility landscapes. We identify modules of coordinately regulated chromatin accessibility at the level of single cells both between and within cell types, with a scalable method that may accelerate progress toward a human cell atlas.},

We applied NICHE-seq to examine the high-order assembly of immune cell networks. NICHE-seq is highly reproducible in spatial tissue reconstruction, enabling identification of rare niche-specific immune subpopulations and gene programs, including natural killer cells within infected B cell follicles and distinct myeloid states in the spleen and tumor. This study establishes NICHE-seq as a broadly applicable method for elucidating high-order spatial organization of cell types and their molecular pathways.},

abstract = {Aims: Many studies have estimated the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) but results have varied due partly to the type of equation used to estimate GFR, type of subjects, and ethnicity. This review aimed to estimate the prevalence of CKD Stage III, accounting for these factors. Methods: 403 studies were identified from Medline using the PubMed search engine, of which 34 studies were eligible. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers, and heterogeneity was assessed using metaregression. Results: The pooled prevalence was estimated using a random effects model. In the general population, the prevalences of CKD Stage III using MDRD equation were 3.6{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2.5, 4.8), 10.7{\%} (95{\%} CI: 4.5-16.9{\%}), and 16.3{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2.1-30.5{\%}) for age groups ≤ 50, 50-60 and {\textgreater} 60 years. The prevalence was about double using the Cockcroft-Gault equations, i.e. 7.5{\%} (95{\%} CI: 6.9-8.2{\%}) and 34.9 (95{\%} CI: 25.9-44.8{\%}) in age ≤ 50 and {\textgreater} 50 years, respectively. The prevalence was similar in Caucasians and Asians aged ≤ 60, i.e. 9.9 versus 9.3{\%}. The prevalence was also higher in the diabetic population than in the general population, i.e. 18.2{\%} versus 10.6{\%}. Conclusions: The pooled prevalence of CKD in the general population varied according to age groups. The prevalence is similar in Caucasians and Asians within age 60 years or younger but other age groups need more studies in order to pool. Individual patient meta-analysis would be appropriate to resolve the causes of heterogeneity. {\textcopyright} 2009 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K. Feistle.},

However, the cellular heterogeneity of the developing CNS has posed a major obstacle to identifying the gene regulatory networks that control these processes. To address this, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile ten developmental stages encompassing the full course of retinal neurogenesis. This allowed us to comprehensively characterize changes in gene expression that occur during initiation of neurogenesis, changes in developmental competence, and specification and differentiation of each major retinal cell type. We identify the NFI transcription factors (Nfia, Nfib, and Nfix) as selectively expressed in late retinal progenitor cells and show that they control bipolar interneuron and M{\"{u}}ller glia cell fate specification and promote proliferative quiescence. We use single-cell RNA-seq analysis to comprehensively profile gene expression during mouse retinal development.

Recently, Argonautes of the bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Thermus thermophilus were demonstrated to be involved in host defense. The Argonaute of the archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (PfAgo) belongs to a different branch in the phylogenetic tree, which is most closely related to that of RNA interference-mediating eukaryotic Argonautes. Here we describe a functional and mechanistic characterization of PfAgo. Like the bacterial counterparts, archaeal PfAgo contributes to host defense by interfering with the uptake of plasmid DNA. PfAgo utilizes small 5'-phosphorylated DNA guides to cleave both single stranded and double stranded DNA targets, and does not utilize RNA as guide or target. Thus, with respect to function and specificity, the archaeal PfAgo resembles bacterial Argonautes much more than eukaryotic Argonautes. These findings demonstrate that the role of Argonautes is conserved through the bacterial and archaeal domains of life and suggests that eukaryotic Argonautes are derived from DNA-guided DNA-interfering host defense systems.},

In all lines tested, butyrate caused hyperacetylation of H3 and H4, and in rat IRC8 cells, H2A and H2B were also affected. In Friend erythroleukemic cells, butyrate also induces the synthesis of a nonhistone chromosomal protein, IP25. Butyrate does not affect the rate of histone acetylation in cell-free extracts or nuclei of Friend cells. Rather, this fatty acid inhibits histone deacetylation. Cell-free extracts of either control cells or butyrate-grown cells contain comparable levels of histone-deacetylating activity. This in vitro activity is inhibited by the addition of butyrate to the extracts. Thus butyrate appears to be an inhibitor of histone deacetylases both in vivo and in vitro. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome.},

abstract = {Liq. Chromatog. Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) is a powerful and widely applied method for the study of biol. systems, biomarker discovery and pharmacol. interventions. LC-MS measurements are, however, significantly complicated by several tech. challenges, including: (1) ionization suppression/enhancement, disturbing the correct quantification of analytes, and (2) the detection of large amts. of sep. deriv. ions, increasing the complexity of the spectra, but not their information content. Here we introduce an exptl. and anal. strategy that leads to robust metabolome profiles in the face of these challenges. Our method is based on rigorous filtering of the measured signals based on a series of sample dilns. Such data sets have the addnl. characteristic that they allow a more robust assessment of detection signal quality for each metabolite. Using our method, almost 80{\%} of the recorded signals can be discarded as uninformative, while important information is retained. As a consequence, we obtain a broader understanding of the information content of our analyses and a better assessment of the metabolites detected in the analyzed data sets. We illustrate the applicability of this method using std. mixts., as well as cell exts. from bacterial samples. It is evident that this method can be applied in many types of LC-MS analyses and more specifically in untargeted metabolomics. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is often used for transcriptome profiling as well as the identification of novel transcripts and alternative splicing events. Typically, RNA-Seq libraries are prepared from total RNA using poly(A) enrichment of the mRNA (mRNA-Seq) to remove ribosomal RNA (rRNA), however, this method fails to capture non-poly(A) transcripts or partially degraded mRNAs. Hence, a mRNA-Seq protocol will not be compatible for use with RNAs coming from Formalin-Fixed and Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) samples.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To address the desire to perform RNA-Seq on FFPE materials, we evaluated two different library preparation protocols that could be compatible for use with small RNA fragments. We obtained paired Fresh Frozen (FF) and FFPE RNAs from multiple tumors and subjected these to different gene expression profiling methods. We tested 11 human breast tumor samples using: (a) FF RNAs by microarray, mRNA-Seq, Ribo-Zero-Seq and DSN-Seq (Duplex-Specific Nuclease) and (b) FFPE RNAs by Ribo-Zero-Seq and DSN-Seq. We also performed these different RNA-Seq protocols using 10 TCGA tumors as a validation set.The data from paired RNA samples showed high concordance in transcript quantification across all protocols and between FF and FFPE RNAs. In both FF and FFPE, Ribo-Zero-Seq removed rRNA with comparable efficiency as mRNA-Seq, and it provided an equivalent or less biased coverage on gene 3' ends. Compared to mRNA-Seq where 69{\%} of bases were mapped to the transcriptome, DSN-Seq and Ribo-Zero-Seq contained significantly fewer reads mapping to the transcriptome (20-30{\%}); in these RNA-Seq protocols, many if not most reads mapped to intronic regions. Approximately 14 million reads in mRNA-Seq and 45-65 million reads in Ribo-Zero-Seq or DSN-Seq were required to achieve the same gene detection levels as a standard Agilent DNA microarray.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that compared to mRNA-Seq and microarrays, Ribo-Zero-Seq provides equivalent rRNA removal efficiency, coverage uniformity, genome-based mapped reads, and consistently high quality quantification of transcripts. Moreover, Ribo-Zero-Seq and DSN-Seq have consistent transcript quantification using FFPE RNAs, suggesting that RNA-Seq can be used with FFPE-derived RNAs for gene expression profiling.},

abstract = {The RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 is the most commonly used genome editing tool and employs RNA–DNA hybridization to spe-cifically cleave genomic sequences 1–5 . Although many modifications have been introduced to the Cas9 system to improve its efficiency and specificity, its practical utility is still limited by its tolerance to guide–target mismatches and the relatively easy formation of second-ary structure by its RNA guides 6 . Argonautes are a family of endonucleases that use 5′ phospho-rylated short single-stranded nucleic acids as guides to cleave tar-gets 7 . Similar to Cas9, Argonautes have key roles in gene expression repression and defense against foreign nucleic acids 7–12 . However, Argonautes differ from Cas9 in many ways 7 . Cas9 only exist in prokaryotes, whereas Argonautes are preserved through evolution and exist in virtually all organisms; although most Argonautes asso-ciate with single-stranded (ss)RNAs and have a central role in RNA silencing, some Argonautes bind ssDNAs and cleave target DNAs 11,13 ; guide RNAs must have a 3′ RNA-RNA hybridization structure for cor-rect Cas9 binding, whereas no specific consensus secondary structure of guides is required for Argonaute binding; whereas Cas9 can only cleave a target upstream of a PAM, there is no specific sequence on targets required for Argonaute. Once Argonaute and guides bind, they affect the physicochemical characteristics of each other and work as a whole with kinetic properties more typical of nucleic-acid-binding proteins 14 . Probably owing to these characteristics, Argonautes have evolved into a large family of proteins that fulfill many different tasks. Here we show that the Argonaute of N. gregoryi can be programmed with ssDNA guides, and is a precise and efficient tool for genome editing in mammalian cells. RESULTS Argonaute derived from N. gregoryi uses DNA guides and cleaves DNA Argonaute from Thermus thermophilus (TtAgo) or Pyrococcus furio-sus (PfAgo) catalyzes cleavage of DNA targets in vitro when supplied with complementary 5′ phosphorylated ssDNA 11,13 . However, both of them require a reaction temperature {\textgreater}65 °C, precluding them from acting in mammalian cells. To find an Argonaute suitable for editing mammalian genome, we performed a search using Position-Specific Iterative Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (PSI-BLAST) against the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein sequence database using the amino acid sequences of TtAgo and PfAgo and identified an Argonaute derived from haloal-kaliphilic archaebacterium N. gregoryi SP2 (NgAgo, protein identifier AFZ73749.1) as a potential candidate. To confirm that NgAgo uses ssDNA guides, we analyzed the nucleic acids purified from NgAgo expressed in Escherichia coli, as those bac-teria produce both 5′-phosphorylated ssRNAs and ssDNAs, and the nucleic acids of proper length (13–25 nt) naturally bind to prokaryo-tic Argonautes 11,12 . Nuclease digestion confirmed that DNA but not RNA binds NgAgo (Fig. 1a). To test whether the NgAgo expressed by E. coli can cleave target DNA at 37 °C in vitro, we performed an in vitro plasmid cleavage assay. We designed three 5′ phosphorylated 24-nucleotide (nt) ssDNA guides, among which two guides were complementary to each other ('FW' and 'RV' guides) and corre-sponded to a target site in plasmid pACYCDuet-eGFP, which had no homologous sequence to the NgAgo-encoding plasmid pGEX6P-1 (Fig. 1b). The other guide had a random sequence without overlap with pACYCDuet-eGFP (noncomplementary ('NC') guide). We also designed a pair of 5′-phosphorylated RNA guides corresponding to the same target site. Before the cleavage assay, we replaced the native nucleic acids bound to the purified) NgAgo with our designed guides by incubating NgAgo with the guides at 55 °C for 1 h. NgAgo could not catalyze cleavage without guide or with the NC guide (Fig. 1b). When supplied with either of the complementary FW or RV guides, NgAgo could nick the negatively supercoiled plas-mid at 37 °C; when supplied with both FW and RV guides, NgAgo linearized the plasmid. However, neither ssDNA guides without 5′ phosphorylation nor 5′-phosphorylated ssRNA guides led to plasmid DNA-guided genome editing using the Natronobacterium gregoryi Argonaute},

In many applications, the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene. The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively little attention in the literature. We present featureCounts, a read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization) and requires far less computer memory. It works with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different sequencing applications. featureCounts is available under GNU General Public License as part of the Subread (http://subread.sourceforge.net) or Rsubread (http://www.bioconductor.org) software packages.},

To infer isoform regulation from high-throughput sequencing of cDNA fragments (RNA-seq), we developed the mixture-of-isoforms (MISO) model, a statistical model that estimates expression of alternatively spliced exons and isoforms and assesses confidence in these estimates. Incorporation of mRNA fragment length distribution in paired-end RNA-seq greatly improved estimation of alternative-splicing levels. MISO also detects differentially regulated exons or isoforms. Application of MISO implicated the RNA splicing factor hnRNP H1 in the regulation of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation, a role that was supported by UV cross-linking-immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) analysis in human cells. Our results provide a probabilistic framework for RNA-seq analysis, give functional insights into pre-mRNA processing and yield guidelines for the optimal design of RNA-seq experiments for studies of gene and isoform expression.},

To uncover dynamic biological mechanisms, bioinformatics tools have become essential to facilitating data interpretation in large-scale analyses. Global metabolomics is one such method for performing systems biology, as metabolites represent the downstream functional products of ongoing biological processes. We have developed XCMS Online, a platform that enables online metabolomics data processing and interpretation. A systems biology workflow recently implemented within XCMS Online enables rapid metabolic pathway mapping using raw metabolomics data for investigating dysregulated metabolic processes. In addition, this platform supports integration of multi-omic (such as genomic and proteomic) data to garner further systems-wide mechanistic insight. Here, we provide an in-depth procedure showing how to effectively navigate and use the systems biology workflow within XCMS Online without a priori knowledge of the platform, including uploading liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) data from metabolite-extracted biological samples, defining the job parameters to identify features, correcting for retention time deviations, conducting statistical analysis of features between sample classes and performing predictive metabolic pathway analysis. Additional multi-omics data can be uploaded and overlaid with previously identified pathways to enhance systems-wide analysis of the observed dysregulations. We also describe unique visualization tools to assist in elucidation of statistically significant dysregulated metabolic pathways.

Such metabolomics studies require a careful analytical and statistical protocol. The strategy included data preprocessing, data analysis, and validation of statistical models.

To validate the found biomarkers statistically, the PLS-DA models were validated by means of a permutation test, biomarker models, and noninformative models. Univariate plots of potential biomarkers were used to obtain insight in up- or downregulation. The strategy proposed proved to be applicable for dealing with large-scale human metabolomics studies.},

There are different ways to perform variable selection in large data sets. Statistical tests are commonly used to identify differentially expressed features for explanatory purposes, whereas Machine Learning wrapper approaches can be used for predictive purposes. In the case of multiple highly correlated variables, another option is to use multivariate exploratory approaches to give more insight into cell biology, biological pathways or complex traits. A simple extension of a sparse PLS exploratory approach is proposed to perform variable selection in a multiclass classification framework. sPLS-DA has a classification performance similar to other wrapper or sparse discriminant analysis approaches on public microarray and SNP data sets. More importantly, sPLS-DA is clearly competitive in terms of computational efficiency and superior in terms of interpretability of the results via valuable graphical outputs. sPLS-DA is available in the R package mixOmics, which is dedicated to the analysis of large biological data sets.},

In this study, we systematically profiled chromatin accessibility and transcriptional dynamics over long-term human retinal and RO development. Our results showed that ROs recapitulated the human retinogenesis to a great extent, but divergent chromatin features were also discovered. We further reconstructed the transcriptional regulatory network governing human and RO retinogenesis in vivo. Notably, NFIB and THRA were identified as regulators in human retinal development. The chromatin modifications between developing human and mouse retina were also cross-analyzed. Notably, we revealed an enriched bivalent modification of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in human but not in murine retinogenesis, suggesting a more dedicated epigenetic regulation on human genome.},

abstract = {Inflammation is a cellular response to factors that challenge the homeostasis of cells and tissues. Cell-associated and soluble pattern-recognition receptors, e.g. Toll-like receptors, inflammasome receptors, and complement components initiate complex cellular cascades by recognizing or sensing different pathogen and damage-associated molecular patterns, respectively. Cytokines and chemokines represent alarm messages for leukocytes and once activated, these cells travel long distances to targeted inflamed tissues. Although it is a crucial survival mechanism, prolonged inflammation is detrimental and participates in numerous chronic age-related diseases. This article will review the onset of inflammation and link its functions to the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of severe vision loss in aged individuals in the developed countries. In this progressive disease, degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) results in the death of photoreceptors, leading to a loss of central vision. The RPE is prone to oxidative stress, a factor that together with deteriorating functionality, e.g. decreased intracellular recycling and degradation due to attenuated heterophagy/autophagy, induces inflammation. In the early phases, accumulation of intracellular lipofuscin in the RPE and extracellular drusen between RPE cells and Bruch's membrane can be clinically detected. Subsequently, in dry (atrophic) AMD there is geographic atrophy with discrete areas of RPE loss whereas in the wet (exudative) form there is neovascularization penetrating from the choroid to retinal layers. Elevations in levels of local and systemic biomarkers indicate that chronic inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of both disease forms.},

abstract = {The ability to measure gene expression on a genome-wide scale is one of the most promising accomplishments in molecular biology. Microarrays, the technology that first permitted this, were riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of variability. Many of these problems are now mitigated, after a decade's worth of statistical methodology development. The recently developed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced variability in comparison to microarrays. However, we show that RNA-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays. In particular, we find guanine-cytosine content (GC-content) has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false positives in downstream results. We also report on commonly observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data normalization. Here, we describe a statistical methodology that improves precision by 42{\%} without loss of accuracy. Our resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic bias introduced by deterministic features such as GC-content and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions.},

Here we wish to define the most appropriate data processing workflow.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We assess the influence of normalisation, missing value imputation, transformation and scaling methods on univariate and multivariate analysis of UHPLC-MS datasets acquired for different mammalian samples.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Our studies have shown that once data are filtered, missing values are not correlated with m/z, retention time or response. Following an exhaustive evaluation, we recommend PQN normalisation with no missing value imputation and no transformation or scaling for univariate analysis. For PCA we recommend applying PQN normalisation with Random Forest missing value imputation, glog transformation and no scaling method. For PLS-DA we recommend PQN normalisation, KNN as the missing value imputation method, generalised logarithm transformation and no scaling. These recommendations are based on searching for the biologically important metabolite features independent of their measured abundance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The appropriate choice of normalisation, missing value imputation, transformation and scaling methods differs depending on the data analysis method and the choice of method is essential to maximise the biological derivations from UHPLC-MS datasets.},

This breadth of data enable variance components analysis that suggests that genes fall into two distinct classes, controlled by either enhancer- or promoter-driven logic, and multiple regression that connects genes to the enhancers that regulate them. Relating transcription factor (TF) expression to the genome-wide accessibility of their binding motifs classifies them as predominantly openers or closers of local chromatin accessibility, pinpointing specific cis-regulatory elements where binding of given TFs is likely functionally relevant, validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq).

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Society for Leukocyte Biology. Inflammation is an adaptive response of the immune system to noxious insults to maintain homeostasis and restore functionality. The retina is considered an immune-privileged tissue as a result of its unique anatomic and physiologic properties. During aging, the retina suffers from a low-grade chronic oxidative insult, which sustains for decades and increases in level with advancing age. As a result, the retinal innate-immune system, particularly microglia and the complement system, undergoes low levels of activation (parainflammation). In many cases, this parainflammatory response can maintain homeostasis in the healthy aging eye. However, in patients with age-related macular degeneration, this parainflammatory response becomes dysregulated and contributes to macular damage. Factors contributing to the dysregulation of age-related retinal parainflammation include genetic predisposition, environmental risk factors, and old age. Dysregulated parainflammation (chronic inflammation) in age-related macular degeneration damages the blood retina barrier, resulting in the breach of retinal-immune privilege, leading to the development of retinal lesions. This review discusses the basic principles of retinal innate-immune responses to endogenous chronic insults in normal aging and in age-related macular degeneration and explores the difference between beneficial parainflammation and the detrimental chronic inflammation in the context of age-related macular degeneration.},

abstract = {Urine has long been a "favored" biofluid among metabolomics researchers. It is sterile, easy-to-obtain in large volumes, largely free from interfering proteins or lipids and chemically complex. However, this chemical complexity has also made urine a particularly difficult substrate to fully understand. As a biological waste material, urine typically contains metabolic breakdown products from a wide range of foods, drinks, drugs, environmental contaminants, endogenous waste metabolites and bacterial by-products. Many of these compounds are poorly characterized and poorly understood. In an effort to improve our understanding of this biofluid we have undertaken a comprehensive, quantitative, metabolome-wide characterization of human urine. This involved both computer-aided literature mining and comprehensive, quantitative experimental assessment/validation. The experimental portion employed NMR spectroscopy, gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), direct flow injection mass spectrometry (DFI/LC-MS/MS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) experiments performed on multiple human urine samples. This multi-platform metabolomic analysis allowed us to identify 445 and quantify 378 unique urine metabolites or metabolite species. The different analytical platforms were able to identify (quantify) a total of: 209 (209) by NMR, 179 (85) by GC-MS, 127 (127) by DFI/LC-MS/MS, 40 (40) by ICP-MS and 10 (10) by HPLC. Our use of multiple metabolomics platforms and technologies allowed us to identify several previously unknown urine metabolites and to substantially enhance the level of metabolome coverage. It also allowed us to critically assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of different platforms or technologies. The literature review led to the identification and annotation of another 2206 urinary compounds and was used to help guide the subsequent experimental studies. An online database containing the complete set of 2651 confirmed human urine metabolite species, their structures (3079 in total), concentrations, related literature references and links to their known disease associations are freely available at http://www.urinemetabolome.ca.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a detrimental neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatments. Due to cellular heterogeneity, defining the roles of immune cell subsets in AD onset and progression has been challenging. Using transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively map all immune populations in wild-type and AD-transgenic (Tg-AD) mouse brains. We describe a novel microglia type associated with neurodegenerative diseases (DAM) and identify markers, spatial localization, and pathways associated with these cells. Immunohistochemical staining of mice and human brain slices shows DAM with intracellular/phagocytic A$\beta$ particles. Single-cell analysis of DAM in Tg-AD and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2)(-/-) Tg-AD reveals that the DAM program is activated in a two-step process. Activation is initiated in a Trem2-independent manner that involves downregulation of microglia checkpoints, followed by activation of a Trem2-dependent program. This unique microglia-type has the potential to restrict neurodegeneration, which may have important implications for future treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

abstract = {Angiogenesis involves dynamic interactions between specialized endothelial tip and stalk cells that are believed to be regulated in part by VEGF and Dll4-Notch signaling. However, our understanding of this process is hampered by limited knowledge of the heterogeneity of endothelial cells and the role of different signaling pathways in specifying endothelial phenotypes. Here, we characterized by single-cell transcriptomics the heterogeneity of mouse endothelial cells and other stromal cells during active angiogenesis in xenograft tumors as well as from adult normal heart, following pharmacologic inhibition of VEGF and Dll4-Notch signaling. We classified tumor endothelial cells into three subpopulations that appeared to correspond with tip-like, transition, and stalk-like cells. Previously identified markers for tip and stalk cells were confirmed and several novel ones discovered. Blockade of VEGF rapidly inhibited cell-cycle genes and strongly reduced the proportion of endothelial tip cells in tumors. In contrast, blockade of Dll4 promoted endothelial proliferation as well as tip cell markers; blockade of both pathways inhibited endothelial proliferation but preserved some tip cells. We also phenotypically classified other tumor stromal cells and found that tumor-associated fibroblasts responded to antiangiogenic drug treatments by upregulating hypoxia-associated genes and producing secreted factors involved in angiogenesis. Overall, our findings better define the heterogeneity of tumor endothelial and other stromal cells and reveal the roles of VEGF and Dll4-Notch in specifying tumor endothelial phenotype, highlighting the response of stromal cells to antiangiogenic therapies. Significance: These findings provide a framework for defining subpopulations of endothelial cells and tumor-associated fibroblasts and their rapid changes in gene expression following antiangiogenic treatment.},

abstract = {Protein-DNA interactions (PDIs) mediate a broad range of functions essential for cellular differentiation, function, and survival. However, it is still a daunting task to comprehensively identify and profile sequence-specific PDIs in complex genomes. Here, we have used a combined bioinformatics and protein microarray-based strategy to systematically characterize the human protein-DNA interactome. We identified 17,718 PDIs between 460 DNA motifs predicted to regulate transcription and 4,191 human proteins of various functional classes. Among them, we recovered many known PDIs for transcription factors (TFs). We identified a large number of unanticipated PDIs for known TFs, as well as for previously uncharacterized TFs. We also found that over three hundred unconventional DNA-binding proteins (uDBPs)-which include RNA-binding proteins, mitochondrial proteins, and protein kinases-showed sequence-specific PDIs. One such uDBP, ERK2, acts as a transcriptional repressor for interferon gamma-induced genes, suggesting important biological roles for such proteins. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Linear models are central to the practice of statistics. They are part of the core knowledge expected of any applied statistician. Linear models are the foundation of a broad range of statistical methodologies; this book is a survey of techniques that grow from a linear model. Our starting point is the regression model with response y and predictors x1,...xp. The model takes the form: y=$\beta$0+$\beta$1x1+...+$\beta$pxp+$\epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is normally distributed. This book presents three extensions to this framework. The first generalizes the y part; the second, the $\epsilon$ part; and the third, the x part of the linear model. Generalized Linear Models: The standard linear model cannot handle nonnormal responses, y, such as counts or proportions. This motivates the development of generalized linear models that can represent categorical, binary and other response types. Mixed Effect Models: Some data has a grouped, nested or hierarchical structure. Repeated measures, longitudinal and multilevel data consist of several observations taken on the same individual or group. This induces a correlation structure in the error, $\epsilon$. Mixed effect models allow the modeling of such data. Nonparametric Regression Models: In the linear model, the predictors, x, are combined in a linear way to model the effect on the response. Sometimes this linearity is insufficient to capture the structure of the data and more flexibility is required. Methods such as additive models, trees and neural networks allow a more flexible regression modeling of the response that combine the predictors in a nonparametric manner. This book aims to provide the reader with a well-stocked toolbox of statistical methodologies. A practicing statistician needs to be aware of and familiar with the basic use of a broad range of ideas and techniques. This book will be a success if the reader is able to recognize and get started on a wide range of problems. However, the breadth comes at the expense of some depth. Fortunately, there are book-length treatments of topics discussed in every chapter of this book, so the reader will know where to go next if needed. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It runs on a wide variety of platforms including the Windows, Linux and Macintosh operating systems. Although there are several excellent statistical packages, only R is both free and possesses the power to perform the analyses demonstrated in this book. While it is possible in principle to learn statistical methods from purely theoretical expositions, I believe most readers learn best from the demonstrated interplay of theory and practice. The data analysis of real examples is woven into this book and all the R commands necessary to reproduce the analyses are provided.},

abstract = {Antihemophilic factor (AHF, Factor VIII) antigen was demonstrated in cultured human endothelial cells by immunofluorescence studies using monospecific rabbit antibody to human AHF. Control studies with cultured human smooth muscle cells and human fibroblasts were negative. By radioimmunoassay it was demonstrated that cultured human endothelial cells contain AHF antigen which is released into the culture medium. Cultured smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts did not have this property. Cultured endothelial cells incorporated radioactive amino acids into high molecular weight, AHF antigen rich protein fractions prepared from the culture media. 7{\%} of the radioactive amino acid counts incorporated into this material were precipitated by globulin prepared from rabbit antiAHF whereas normal rabbit globulin precipitated only 1.5{\%} of the counts. Although cultured endothelial cells actively synthesize AHF antigen, AHF procoagulant activity was not detected in the culture medium. Studies seeking a basis for the lack of procoagulant activity have not clarified this deficiency, but they have established that exogenous AHF procoagulant activity is not inactivated by the tissue culture system.},

Recent work has made progress in our understanding of classical Argonaute-mediated gene-silencing principles, such as the effects on mRNA translation and decay, but has also implicated Argonaute proteins in several other cellular processes, such as transcriptional regulation and splicing.},

SF3B1-mutant samples showed a splicing profile distinct from that of wild-type tumors. TRAF7 alterations occurred primarily in the WD40 domain and were, except in one case, mutually exclusive with NF2 alterations. We found recurrent gene fusions and splice alterations to be frequent mechanisms for inactivation of NF2, BAP1 and SETD2.

abstract = {Although CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases are widely used for genome editing, the range of sequences that Cas9 can recognize is constrained by the need for a specific protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). As a result, it can often be difficult to target double-stranded breaks (DSBs) with the precision that is necessary for various genome-editing applications. The ability to engineer Cas9 derivatives with purposefully altered PAM specificities would address this limitation. Here we show that the commonly used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) can be modified to recognize alternative PAM sequences using structural information, bacterial selection-based directed evolution, and combinatorial design. These altered PAM specificity variants enable robust editing of endogenous gene sites in zebrafish and human cells not currently targetable by wild-type SpCas9, and their genome-wide specificities are comparable to wild-type SpCas9 as judged by GUIDE-seq analysis. In addition, we identify and characterize another SpCas9 variant that exhibits improved specificity in human cells, possessing better discrimination against off-target sites with non-canonical NAG and NGA PAMs and/or mismatched spacers. We also find that two smaller-size Cas9 orthologues, Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9 (St1Cas9) and Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9), function efficiently in the bacterial selection systems and in human cells, suggesting that our engineering strategies could be extended to Cas9s from other species. Our findings provide broadly useful SpCas9 variants and, more importantly, establish the feasibility of engineering a wide range of Cas9s with altered and improved PAM specificities.},

abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the risk factors for pterygium in the dry, high altitude province of Ilam, Iran. Methods: The study included patients who presented to ophthalmology clinic. The patients were divided into two groups: 210 diagnosed with pterygium or pinguecula (unilateral or bilateral), and 210 healthy controls. Demographic variables, living environment, disease type, disease laterality, family history of pterygium as well as history of smoking, working outdoors, baking, welding, ocular conditions (trachoma keratopathy, glaucoma, refractive error, and dry eye), use of glasses, ultraviolet light exposure, and systemic conditions were collected from both groups and compared for risk assessment. Results: Univariate analysis revealed that age (P = 0.001), sex (P = 0.001), family history of pterygium (P = 0.001), positive history of smoking (P {\textless} 0.001), history of baking (P = 0.045), welding experience (P {\textless} 0.001), severe blepharitis (P {\textless} 0.001), hyperopia (P {\textless} 0.001), dry eye (P {\textless} 0.001), hypertension (P {\textless} 0.001), ischemic heart disease (P {\textless} 0.001), obesity (P = 0.038), and primary residential area (P = 0.025) had significant associations with increased incidence of pterygium. However, in multivariate analysis, only family history of pterygium, cigarette smoking, history of baking, age, and severe blepharitis were significantly associated with the incidence of pterygium (P{\textless}0.001, P{\textless}0.001, P = 0.002, P = 0.023 and P = 0.002, respectively). Conclusion: This study tested more risk factors related to the prevalence of pterygium compared to previous studies. It also confirmed previously established risk factors. Family history of pterygium and blepharitis were risk factors that have not been reported in previous studies and were found to be significantly associated with the development of pterygium in this study.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics relies on MS2 data for structural characterization of metabolites. To obtain the high-quality MS2 data necessary to support metabolite identifications, ions of interest must be purely isolated for fragmentation. Here, we show that metabolomic MS2 data are frequently characterized by contaminating ions that prevent structural identification. Although using narrow-isolation windows can minimize contaminating MS2 fragments, even narrow windows are not always selective enough, and they can complicate data analysis by removing isotopic patterns from MS2 spectra. Moreover, narrow windows can significantly reduce sensitivity. In this work, we introduce a novel, two-part approach for performing metabolomic identifications that addresses these issues. First, we collect MS2 scans with less stringent isolation settings to obtain improved sensitivity at the expense of specificity. Then, by evaluating MS2 fragment intensities as a function of retention time and precursor mass targeted for MS2 analysis, we obtain deconvolved MS2 spectra that are consistent with pure standards and can therefore be used for metabolite identification. The value of our approach is highlighted with metabolic extracts from brain, liver, astrocytes, as well as nerve tissue, and performance is evaluated by using pure metabolite standards in combination with simulations based on raw MS2 data from the METLIN metabolite database. A R package implementing the algorithms used in our workflow is available on our laboratory website ( http://pattilab.wustl.edu/decoms2.php ).},

abstract = {Deconvolution is a mathematical process of resolving an observed function into its constituent elements. In the field of biomedical research, deconvolution analysis is applied to obtain single cell-type or tissue specific signatures from a mixed signal and most of them follow the linearity assumption. Although recent development of next generation sequencing technology suggests RNA-seq as a fast and accurate method for obtaining transcriptomic profiles, few studies have been conducted to investigate best RNA-seq quantification methods that yield the optimum linear space for deconvolution analysis. Using a benchmark RNA-seq dataset, we investigated the linearity of abundance estimated from seven most popular RNA-seq quantification methods both at the gene and isoform levels. Linearity is evaluated through parameter estimation, concordance analysis and residual analysis based on a multiple linear regression model. Results show that count data gives poor parameter estimations, large intercepts and high inter-sample variability; while TPM value from Kallisto and Salmon shows high linearity in all analyses. Salmon and Kallisto TPM data gives the best fit to the linear model studied. This suggests that TPM values estimated from Salmon and Kallisto are the ideal RNA-seq measurements for deconvolution studies.},

Studies of these viruses proved to be instrumental for the expansion of knowledge on viral diversity and evolution. The Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus 2 (SIRV2) is a model to study virus-host interactions in Archaea. It is a lytic virus that exploits a unique egress mechanism based on the formation of remarkable pyramidal structures on the host cell envelope. Using whole-transcriptome sequencing, we present here a global map defining host and viral gene expression during the infection cycle of SIRV2 in its hyperthermophilic host S. islandicus LAL14/1. This information was used, in combination with a yeast two-hybrid analysis of SIRV2 protein interactions, to advance current understanding of viral gene functions. As a consequence of SIRV2 infection, transcription of more than one-third of S. islandicus genes was differentially regulated. While expression of genes involved in cell division decreased, those genes playing a role in antiviral defense were activated on a large scale. Expression of genes belonging to toxin-antitoxin and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas systems was specifically pronounced. The observed different degree of activation of various CRISPR-Cas systems highlights the specialized functions they perform. The information on individual gene expression and activation of antiviral defense systems is expected to aid future studies aimed at detailed understanding of the functions and interplay of these systems in vivo.},

abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) involves the loss of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptors and is one of the leading causes of blindness in the elderly. Oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA has been associated with RPE dysfunction and AMD. In this study, we evaluated oxidative stress in AMD and the efficacy of antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), in protecting RPE from oxidative damage. To test this idea, primary cultures of RPE from human donors with AMD (n = 32) or without AMD (No AMD, n = 21) were examined for expression of NADPH oxidase (NOX) genes, a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, the cells were pretreated with NAC for 2 hours and then treated with either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) to induce cellular oxidation. Twenty-four hours after treatment, ROS production, cell survival, the content of glutathione (GSH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and cellular bioenergetics were measured. We found increased expression of p22phox, a NOX regulator, in AMD cells compared to No AMD cells (p = 0.02). In both AMD and No AMD cells, NAC pretreatment reduced t-BHP-induced ROS production and protected from H2O2-induced cell death and ATP depletion. In the absence of oxidation, NAC treatment improved mitochondrial function in both groups (p {\textless} 0.01). Conversely, the protective response exhibited by NAC was disease-dependent for some parameters. In the absence of oxidation, NAC significantly reduced ROS production (p {\textless} 0.001) and increased GSH content (p = 0.02) only in RPE from AMD donors. Additionally, NAC-mediated protection from H2O2-induced GSH depletion (p = 0.04) and mitochondrial dysfunction (p {\textless} 0.05) was more pronounced in AMD cells compared with No AMD cells. These results demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of NAC by mitigating oxidative damage in RPE. Additionally, the favorable outcomes observed for AMD RPE support NAC's relevance and the potential therapeutic value in treating AMD.},

However, the nature and extent of TCR cross-reactivity has not been conclusively measured experimentally. We developed a system to identify MHC-presented peptide ligands by combining TCR selection of highly diverse yeast-displayed peptide-MHC libraries with deep sequencing. Although we identified hundreds of peptides reactive with each of five different mouse and human TCRs, the selected peptides possessed TCR recognition motifs that bore a close resemblance to their known antigens. This structural conservation of the TCR interaction surface allowed us to exploit deep-sequencing information to computationally identify activating microbial and self-ligands for human autoimmune TCRs. The mechanistic basis of TCR cross-reactivity described here enables effective surveillance of diverse self and foreign antigens without necessitating degenerate recognition of nonhomologous peptides. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Purpose: To differentiate the plasma metabolomic profile of patients with age related macular degeneration (AMD) from that of controls, by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Methods: Two cohorts (total of 396 subjects) representative of central Portugal and Boston, USA phenotypes were studied. For each cohort, subjects were grouped according to AMD stage (early, intermediate and late). Multivariate analysis of plasma NMR spectra was performed, followed by signal integration and univariate analysis. Results: Small changes were detected in the levels of some amino acids, organic acids, dimethyl sulfone and specific lipid moieties, thus providing some biochemical information on the disease. The possible confounding effects of gender, smoking history and age were assessed in each cohort and found to be minimal when compared to that of the disease. A similar observation was noted in relation to age-related comorbidities. Furthermore, partially distinct putative AMD metabolite fingerprints were noted for the two cohorts studied, reflecting the importance of nutritional and other lifestyle habits in determining AMD metabolic response and potential biomarker fingerprints. Notably, some of the metabolite changes detected were noted as potentially differentiating controls from patients diagnosed with early AMD. Conclusion: For the first time, this study showed metabolite changes in the plasma of patients with AMD as compared to controls, using NMR. Geographical origins were seen to affect AMD patients' metabolic profile and some metabolites were found to be valuable in potentially differentiating controls from early stage AMD patients. Metabolomics has the potential of identifying biomarkers for AMD, and further work in this area is warranted.},

However, differential usage of gene transcripts between conditions (isoform switching) has not been comprehensively characterized in and across cancer types. To this end, we developed methods for identification and visualization of isoform switches with predicted functional consequences. Using these methods, we characterized isoform switching in RNA-seq data from {\textgreater}5,500 cancer patients covering 12 solid cancer types. Isoform switches with potential functional consequences were common, affecting approximately 19{\%} of multiple transcript genes. Among these, isoform switches leading to loss of DNA sequence encoding protein domains were more frequent than expected, particularly in pancancer switches. We identified several isoform switches as powerful biomarkers: 31 switches were highly predictive of patient survival independent of cancer types. Our data constitute an important resource for cancer researchers, available through interactive web tools. Moreover, our methods, available as an R package, enable systematic analysis of isoform switches from other RNA-seq datasets.Implications: This study indicates that isoform switches with predicted functional consequences are common and important in dysfunctional cells, which in turn means that gene expression should be analyzed at the isoform level.

This article looks at the dual problem of annotating peaks in a sample with a metabolite, together with putatively annotating whether a metabolite is present in the sample. The starting point of the approach is a Bayesian clustering of peaks into groups, each corresponding to putative adducts and isotopes of a single metabolite.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The Bayesian modelling introduced here combines information from the mass-to-charge ratio, retention time and intensity of each peak, together with a model of the inter-peak dependency structure, to increase the accuracy of peak annotation.

Extensive validation experiments using authentic chemical standards show that this system is able to produce more accurate putative identifications than other state-of-the-art systems, while at the same time giving a probabilistic measure of confidence in the annotations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software has been implemented as part of the mzMatch metabolomics analysis pipeline, which is available for download at http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/.},

abstract = {In mammals, extensive chromatin reorganization is essential for reprogramming terminally committed gametes to a totipotent state during preimplantation development. However, the global chromatin landscape and its dynamics in this period remain unexplored. Here we report a genome-wide map of accessible chromatin in mouse preimplantation embryos using an improved assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) approach with CRISPR/Cas9-assisted mitochondrial DNA depletion. We show that despite extensive parental asymmetry in DNA methylomes, the chromatin accessibility between the parental genomes is globally comparable after major zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Accessible chromatin in early embryos is widely shaped by transposable elements and overlaps extensively with putative cis-regulatory sequences. Unexpectedly, accessible chromatin is also found near the transcription end sites of active genes. By integrating the maps of cis-regulatory elements and single-cell transcriptomes, we construct the regulatory network of early development, which helps to identify the key modulators for lineage specification. Finally, we find that the activities of cis-regulatory elements and their associated open chromatin diminished before major ZGA.

abstract = {Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are sensors for a wide range of cellular and environmental signals, but elucidating how these channels respond to physical and chemical stimuli has been hampered by a lack of detailed structural information. Here we exploit advances in electron cryo-microscopy to determine the structure of a mammalian TRP channel, TRPV1, at 3.4 {\{}{\AA}{\}} resolution, breaking the side-chain resolution barrier for membrane proteins without crystallization. Like voltage-gated channels, TRPV1 exhibits four-fold symmetry around a central ion pathway formed by transmembrane segments 5-6 (S5-S6) and the intervening pore loop, which is flanked by S1-S4 voltage-sensor-like domains. TRPV1 has a wide extracellular 'mouth' with a short selectivity filter. The conserved 'TRP domain' interacts with the S4-S5 linker, consistent with its contribution to allosteric modulation. Subunit organization is facilitated by interactions among cytoplasmic domains, including amino-terminal ankyrin repeats. These observations provide a structural blueprint for understanding unique aspects of TRP channel function.},

These dimensions include myriad properties describing genome, epigenome, transcriptome, microbiome, phenotype, and lifestyle. No single data type, however, can capture the complexity of all the factors relevant to understanding a phenomenon such as a disease. Integrative methods that combine data from multiple technologies have thus emerged as critical statistical and computational approaches. The key challenge in developing such approaches is the identification of effective models to provide a comprehensive and relevant systems view. An ideal method can answer a biological or medical question, identifying important fea-tures and predicting outcomes, by harnessing heterogeneous data across several dimensions of biological variation. In this Review, we describe the principles of data integration and discuss current methods and available implementations. We provide examples of successful data integration in biology and medicine. Finally, we discuss current challenges in biomedical integrative methods and our perspective on the future development of the field.},

Much research has revealed the promise of deep learning as a powerful tool to transform protein big data into valuable knowledge, leading to scientific discoveries and practical solutions. In this review, we summarize recent publications on deep learning predictive approaches in the field ofmining protein data. The application architectures of these methods include multilayer perceptrons, stacked autoencoders, deep belief networks, two- or three-dimensional convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and complex neural networks and are described from five perspectives: residue-level prediction, sequence-level prediction, three-dimensional structural analysis, interaction prediction, and mass spectrometry data mining. The advantages and deficiencies of these architectures are presented in relation to various tasks in protein data mining. Additionally, some practical issues and their future directions are discussed, such as robust deep learning for protein noisy data, architecture optimization for specific tasks, efficient deep learning for limited protein data, multimodal deep learning for heterogeneous protein data, and interpretable deep learning for protein understanding.

There has been a recent development to replace spectral libraries by molecular structure databases when searching the MS/MS data of the unknown compound. Several tools have been developed for this task, including CFM-ID, MetFrag, MAGMa(+), FingerID and CSI:FingerID. These methods are already helpful for everyday metabolomics; with further advances, these methods can become indispensable tools for tomorrow's metabolomics. Here, I discuss several questions related to this task, such as: Why not wait for spectral libraries to grow sufficiently? Why evaluate methods outside their ‘comfort zone'? Should we use prior information such as citation frequencies? And, ultimately: are we there yet?},

abstract = {Background: Various alterations in lipid metabolism have been observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Objectives: To determine the levels of lipid species in plasma from CKD and hemodialysis (HD) patients and test their association with CKD severity and patient outcome. Methods: Seventy-seven patients with CKD stage 2 to HD were grouped into classes of CKD severity at baseline and followed-up for 3.5 years for the occurrence of transition to HD or death (combined outcome). Plasma levels of phosphatidylcholines (PCs), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), sphingomyelins (SMs), and fatty acids were analyzed by flow-injection analysis coupled to tandem mass spectrometry or gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Kruskal Wallis rank tests and Cox regressions were used to analyze the association of lipids with CKD severity and the risk of combined outcome, respectively. Results: The plasma level of PCs, LPCs, and SMs was decreased in HD patients compared with nondialyzed CKD patients (all P {\textless}.05), whereas esterified and/or nonesterified fatty acids level did not change. Thirty-four lipids displayed significantly lower abundance in plasma of HD patients, whereas elaidic acid (C18:1$\omega$9t) level was increased (P {\textless}.001). The total amount of LPCs and individual LPCs were associated with better outcome (P {\textless}.05). In particular, LPC 18:2 and LPC 20:3 were statistically associated with outcome in adjusted models (P {\textless}.05). Discussion: In HD patients, a reduction in plasma lipids is observed. Some of the alterations, namely reduced LPCs, were associated with the risk of adverse outcome. These changes could be related to metabolic dysfunctions.},

We report chromatin accessibility profiles from more than 15,000 single cells and use these data to cluster cells on the basis of chromatin accessibility landscapes. We identify modules of coordinately regulated chromatin accessibility at the level of single cells both between and within cell types, with a scalable method that may accelerate progress toward a human cell atlas.},

Cas9-guide RNA complexes are also effective genome engineering agents in animals and plants. Here we use single-molecule and bulk biochemical experiments to determine how Cas9-RNA interrogates DNA to find specific cleavage sites. We show that both binding and cleavage of DNA by Cas9-RNA require recognition of a short trinucleotide protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Non-target DNA binding affinity scales with PAM density, and sequences fully complementary to the guide RNA but lacking a nearby PAM are ignored by Cas9-RNA. Competition assays provide evidence that DNA strand separation and RNA-DNA heteroduplex formation initiate at the PAM and proceed directionally towards the distal end of the target sequence. Furthermore, PAM interactions trigger Cas9 catalytic activity. These results reveal how Cas9 uses PAM recognition to quickly identify potential target sites while scanning large DNA molecules, and to regulate scission of double-stranded DNA.},

A comprehensive understanding of the role of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns, the methylome, requires quantitative determination of the methylation states of all CpG sites in a genome. So far, analyses of the complete methylome by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) are rare because of the required large DNA quantities, substantial bioinformatic resources and high sequencing costs. Here we describe a detailed protocol for tagmentation-based WGBS (T-WGBS) and demonstrate its reliability in comparison with conventional WGBS. In T-WGBS, a hyperactive Tn5 transposase fragments the DNA and appends sequencing adapters in a single step. T-WGBS requires not more than 20 ng of input DNA; hence, the protocol allows the comprehensive methylome analysis of limited amounts of DNA isolated from precious biological specimens.

By using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of- flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-ToF-MS), hundreds to thousands of peaks with a unique retention time are routinely detected from most biological samples in an untargeted profiling m/z and experiment. Each peak, termed a metabolomic feature, can be characterized on the basis of its accurate mass, retention time, and tandem mass spectral fragmentation pattern. Here a 7-step protocol is suggested for such a characterization by using the METLIN metabolite database. The protocol starts from untargeted metabolomic LC-Q-ToF-MS data that has been analyzed with the bioinformatic program XCMS, and describes a strategy for selecting interesting features as well as performing subsequent targeted tandem mass spectrometry. The 7 steps described will require 2-4 hours to complete per feature, depending on the compound. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {Crosstalk between neighboring cells underlies many biological processes, including cell signaling, proliferation and differen- tiation. Current single-cell genomic technologies profile each cell separately after tissue dissociation, losing information on cell–cell interactions. In the present study, we present an approach for sequencing physically interacting cells (PIC-seq), which combines cell sorting of physically interacting cells (PICs) with single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using computational modeling, PIC-seq systematically maps in situ cellular interactions and characterizes their molecular crosstalk. We apply PIC-seq to inter- rogate diverse interactions including immune–epithelial PICs in neonatal murine lungs. Focusing on interactions between T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro and in vivo, we map T cell–DC interaction preferences, and discover regulatory T cells as a major T cell subtype interacting with DCs in mouse draining lymph nodes. Analysis of T cell–DC pairs reveals an interaction-specific program between pathogen-presenting migratory DCs and T cells. PIC-seq provides a direct and broadly applicable technology to characterize intercellular interaction-specific pathways at high resolution.},

abstract = {Biological systems are increasingly being studied in a holistic manner, using omics approaches, to provide quantitative and qualitative descriptions of the diverse collection of cellular components. Among the omics approaches, metabolomics, which deals with the quantitative global profiling of small molecules or metabolites, is being used extensively to explore the dynamic response of living systems, such as organelles, cells, tissues, organs and whole organisms, under diverse physiological and pathological conditions. This technology is now used routinely in a number of applications, including basic and clinical research, agriculture, microbiology, food science, nutrition, pharmaceutical research, environmental science and the development of biofuels. Of the multiple analytical platforms available to perform such analyses, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry have come to dominate, owing to the high resolution and large datasets that can be generated with these techniques. The large multidimensional datasets that result from such studies must be processed and analyzed to render this data meaningful. Thus, bioinformatics tools are essential for the efficient processing of huge datasets, the characterization of the detected signals, and to align multiple datasets and their features. This paper provides a state-of-the-art overview of the data processing tools available, and reviews a collection of recent reports on the topic. Data conversion, pre-processing, alignment, normalization and statistical analysis are introduced, with their advantages and disadvantages, and comparisons are made to guide the reader.},

Integration of ATAC-seq (the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) with TCGA multi-omic data identifies a large number of putative distal enhancers that distinguish molecular subtypes of cancers, uncovers specific driving transcription factors via protein-DNA footprints, and nominates long-range gene-regulatory interactions in cancer. These data reveal genetic risk loci of cancer predisposition as active DNA regulatory elements in cancer, identify gene-regulatory interactions underlying cancer immune evasion, and pinpoint noncoding mutations that drive enhancer activation and may affect patient survival. These results suggest a systematic approach to understanding the noncoding genome in cancer to advance diagnosis and therapy.},

abstract = {Structural and gene expression changes in the microvasculature of the human choroid occur during normal aging and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In this study, we sought to determine the impact of aging and AMD on expression of the endothelial cell glycoprotein CD34. Sections from 58 human donor eyes were categorized as either young (under age 40), age-matched controls ({\textgreater} age 60 without AMD), or AMD affected ({\textgreater}age 60 with early AMD, geographic atrophy, or choroidal neovascularization). Dual labeling of sections with Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I lectin (UEA-I) and CD34 antibodies was performed, and the percentage of capillaries labeled with UEA-I but negative for anti-CD34 was determined. In addition, published databases of mouse and human retinal pigment epithelium-choroid were evaluated and CD34 expression compared between young and old eyes. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that while CD34 and UEA-I were colocalized in young eyes, there was variable loss of CD34 immunoreactivity in older donor eyes. While differences between normal aging and AMD were not significant, the percentage of CD34 negative capillaries in old eyes, compared to young eyes, was highly significant (p = 3.8×10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-6{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). Endothelial cells in neovascular membranes were invariably CD34 positive. Published databases show either a significant decrease in Cd34 (mouse) or a trend toward decreased CD34 (human) in aging. These findings suggest that UEA-I and endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity are more consistent markers of aging endothelial cells in the choroid, and suggest a possible mechanism for the increased inflammatory milieu in the aging choroid. {\textcopyright} 2014 Sohn et al.},

By single-cell RNA sequencing 28,337 murine choroidal ECs (CECs) and sprouting CNV-ECs, we constructed a taxonomy to characterize their heterogeneity. Comparison with murine lung tumor ECs (TECs) revealed congruent marker gene expression by distinct EC phenotypes across tissues and diseases, suggesting similar angiogenic mechanisms. Trajectory inference predicted that differentiation of venous to angiogenic ECs was accompanied by metabolic transcriptome plasticity. ECs displayed metabolic transcriptome heterogeneity during cell-cycle progression and in quiescence. Hypothesizing that conserved genes are important, we used an integrated analysis, based on congruent transcriptome analysis, CEC-tailored genome-scale metabolic modeling, and gene expression meta-analysis in cross-species datasets, followed by in vitro and in vivo validation, to identify SQLE and ALDH18A1 as previously unknown metabolic angiogenic targets.},

abstract = {in many research areas scientists are interested in clustering objects within small datasets while making use of prior knowledge from large reference datasets. We propose a method to apply the machine learning concept of transfer learning to unsupervised clustering problems and show its effectiveness in the field of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). The goal of scRNA-Seq experiments is often the definition and cataloguing of cell types from the transcriptional output of individual cells. To improve the clustering of small disease- or tissue-specific datasets, for which the identification of rare cell types is often problematic, we propose a transfer learning method to utilize large and well-annotated reference datasets, such as those produced by the Human Cell Atlas. Our approach modifies the dataset of interest while incorporating key information from the larger reference dataset via non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). The modified dataset is subsequently provided to a clustering algorithm. We empirically evaluate the benefits of our approach on simulated scRNA-Seq data as well as on publicly available datasets. Finally, we present results for the analysis of a recently published small dataset and find improved clustering when transferring knowledge from a large reference dataset. implementations of the method are available at https://github.com/nicococo/scRNA.},

abstract = {Almost all polymerase II transcripts undergo alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Here, we review the functions of alternative splicing events that have been experimentally determined. The overall function of alternative splicing is to increase the diversity of mRNAs expressed from the genome. Alternative splicing changes proteins encoded by mRNAs, which has profound functional effects. Experimental analysis of these protein isoforms showed that alternative splicing regulates binding between proteins, between proteins and nucleic acids as well as between proteins and membranes. Alternative splicing regulates the localization of proteins, their enzymatic properties and their interaction with ligands. In most cases, changes caused by individual splicing isoforms are small. However, cells typically coordinate numerous changes in 'splicing programs', which can have strong effects on cell proliferation, cell survival and properties of the nervous system. Due to its widespread usage and molecular versatility, alternative splicing emerges as a central element in gene regulation that interferes with almost every biological function analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease underlined by the degradation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, photoreceptors, and choriocapillares, but the exact mechanism of cell death in AMD is not completely clear. This mechanism is important for prevention of and therapeutic intervention in AMD, which is a hardly curable disease. Present reports suggest that both apoptosis and pyroptosis (cell death dependent on caspase-1) as well as necroptosis (regulated necrosis dependent on the proteins RIPK3 and MLKL, caspase-independent) can be involved in the AMD-related death of RPE cells. Autophagy, a cellular clearing system, plays an important role in AMD pathogenesis, and this role is closely associated with the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a central event for advanced AMD. Autophagy can play a role in apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis, but its contribution to AMD-specific cell death is not completely clear. Autophagy can be involved in the regulation of proteins important for cellular antioxidative defense, including Nrf2, which can interact with p62/SQSTM, a protein essential for autophagy. As oxidative stress is implicated in AMD pathogenesis, autophagy can contribute to this disease by deregulation of cellular defense against the stress. However, these and other interactions do not explain the mechanisms of RPE cell death in AMD. In this review, we present basic mechanisms of autophagy and its involvement in AMD pathogenesis and try to show a regulatory role of autophagy in RPE cell death. This can result in considering the genes and proteins of autophagy as molecular targets in AMD prevention and therapy.},

We identified 66 blood pressure-associated loci, of which 17 were new; 15 harbored multiple distinct association signals. The 66 index SNPs were enriched for cis-regulatory elements, particularly in vascular endothelial cells, consistent with a primary role in blood pressure control through modulation of vascular tone across multiple tissues. The 66 index SNPs combined in a risk score showed comparable effects in 64,421 individuals of non-European descent. The 66-SNP blood pressure risk score was significantly associated with target organ damage in multiple tissues but with minor effects in the kidney.

abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics has transformed our ability to characterize cell states, but deep biological understanding requires more than a taxonomic listing of clusters. As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets to better understand cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a strategy to “anchor” diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate single-cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but also across different modalities. After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns. Our work presents a strategy for the assembly of harmonized references and transfer of information across datasets.},

abstract = {Normalization of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data has proven essential to ensure accurate inference of expression levels. Here, we show that usual normalization approaches mostly account for sequencing depth and fail to correct for library preparation and other more complex unwanted technical effects. We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving multiple laboratories, technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.},

abstract = {Small variations in nucleic acid sequences can have far-reaching phenotypic consequences. Reliably distinguishing closely related sequences is therefore important for research and clinical applications. Here, we demonstrate that conditionally fluorescent DNA probes are capable of distinguishing variations of a single base in a stretch of target DNA. These probes use a novel programmable mechanism in which each single nucleotide polymorphism generates two thermodynamically destabilizing mismatch bubbles rather than the single mismatch formed during typical hybridization-based assays. Up to a 12,000-fold excess of a target that contains a single nucleotide polymorphism is required to generate the same fluorescence as one equivalent of the intended target, and detection works reliably over a wide range of conditions. Using these probes we detected point mutations in a 198 base-pair subsequence of the Escherichia coli rpoB gene. That our probes are constructed from multiple oligonucleotides circumvents synthesis limitations and enables long continuous DNA sequences to be probed.},

Altered expression and dysfunctions of P2X7 receptors caused by genetic deletions, mutations, and polymorphic variations have been linked to various diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension. Despite the availability of crystal structures of P2X receptors, the mechanism of competitive antagonist action for P2X receptors remains controversial. Here, we determine the crystal structure of the chicken P2X7 receptor in complex with the competitive P2X antagonist, TNP-ATP. The structure reveals an expanded, incompletely activated conformation of the channel, and identified the unique recognition manner of TNP-ATP, which is distinct from that observed in the previously determined human P2X3 receptor structure. A structure-based computational analysis furnishes mechanistic insights into the TNP-ATP-dependent inhibition. Our work provides structural insights into the functional mechanism of the P2X competitive antagonist.},

Here we globally profile chromatin accessibility using ATAC-Seq in the retina and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) from AMD and control patients. Global decreases in chromatin accessibility occur in the RPE with early AMD, and in the retina of advanced disease, suggesting that dysfunction in the RPE drives disease onset. Footprints of photoreceptor and RPE-specific transcription factors are enriched in differentially accessible regions (DARs). Genes associated with DARs show altered expression in AMD. Cigarette smoke treatment of RPE cells recapitulates chromatin accessibility changes seen in AMD, providing an epigenetic link between a known risk factor for AMD and AMD pathology. Finally, overexpression of HDAC11 is partially responsible for the observed reduction in chromatin accessibility, suggesting that HDAC11 may be a potential new therapeutic target for AMD.},

The use of powerful analytical techniques (e.g., high-resolution mass spectrometry) provides high-dimensional data, often with noisy and collinear structures. Such amount of information-rich mass spectrometry data requires extensive processing in order to handle metabolomic data sets appropriately and to further assess sample classification/discrimination and biomarker discovery. This review shows the steps involved in the data analysis workflow for both targeted and untargeted metabolomic studies. Especial attention is focused on the distinct methodologies that have been developed in the last decade for the untargeted case. Furthermore, some powerful and recent alternatives based on the use of chemometric tools will also be discussed. In general terms, this review helps researchers to critically explore the distinct alternatives for LC-MS metabolomic data analysis to better choose the most appropriate for their case study.},

abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved sequence-specific gene regulatory mechanism mediated by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is composed of a single-stranded guide RNA and an Argonaute protein. The PIWI domain, a highly conserved motif within Argonaute, has been shown to adopt an RNase H fold critical for the endonuclease cleavage activity of RISC. Here we report the crystal structure of Archaeoglobus fulgidus Piwi protein bound to double-stranded RNA, thereby identifying the binding pocket for guide-strand 5'-end recognition and providing insight into guide-strand-mediated messenger RNA target recognition. The phosphorylated 5' end of the guide RNA is anchored within a highly conserved basic pocket, supplemented by the carboxy-terminal carboxylate and a bound divalent cation. The first nucleotide from the 5' end of the guide RNA is unpaired and stacks over a conserved tyrosine residue, whereas successive nucleotides form a four-base-pair RNA duplex. Mutation of the corresponding amino acids that contact the 5' phosphate in human Ago2 resulted in attenuated mRNA cleavage activity. Our structure of the Piwi-RNA complex, and that determined elsewhere, provide direct support for the 5' region of the guide RNA serving as a nucleation site for pairing with target mRNA and for a fixed distance separating the RISC-mediated mRNA cleavage site from the anchored 5' end of the guide RNA.},

With the increasing amounts of data being produced, mere description of investigations as text in manuscripts is not sufficient to enable re-use anymore: the underlying data needs to be published together with the findings in the literature to maximise the benefit from public and private expenditure and to take advantage of an enormous opportunity to improve scientific reproducibility in metabolomics and cognate disciplines. Reporting recommendations in metabolomics started to emerge about a decade ago and were mostly concerned with inventories of the information that had to be reported in the literature for consistency. In recent years, metabolomics data standards have developed extensively, to include the primary research data, derived results and the experimental description and importantly the metadata in a machine-readable way. This includes vendor independent data standards such as mzML for mass spectrometry and nmrML for NMR raw data that have both enabled the development of advanced data processing algorithms by the scientific community. Standards such as ISA-Tab cover essential metadata, including the experimental design, the applied protocols, association between samples, data files and the experimental factors for further statistical analysis. Altogether, they pave the way for both reproducible research and data reuse, including meta-analyses. Further incentives to prepare standards compliant data sets include new opportunities to publish data sets, but also require a little "arm twisting" in the author guidelines of scientific journals to submit the data sets to public repositories such as the NIH Metabolomics Workbench or MetaboLights at EMBL-EBI. In the present article, we look at standards for data sharing, investigate their impact in metabolomics and give suggestions to improve their adoption.},

abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in elderly people globally. It is estimated that there will be more Asians with AMD than the rest of the world combined by 2050. In Asian populations, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) is a common subtype of exudative AMD, while choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD (CNV-AMD) is the typical subtype in Western populations. The two subtypes share many common clinical features and risk factors, but also have different epidemiological and clinical characteristics, natural history and treatment outcomes that point to distinct pathophysiological processes. Recent research in the fields of genetics, proteomics and imaging has provided further clarification of differences between PCV and CNV-AMD. Importantly, these differences have manifested as disparity in response to intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment between PCV and CNV-AMD, emphasizing the need for accurate diagnosis of PCV and in distinguishing PCV from CNV-AMD, particularly in Asian patients. Current clinical trials of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy and photodynamic therapy will provide clearer perspectives of evidence-based management of PCV and may lead to paradigm shifts in therapeutic strategies away from those currently employed in the treatment of CNV-AMD. Further research is needed to clarify the relative contribution of specific pathways in inflammation, complement activation, extracellular matrix dysregulation, lipid metabolism and angiogenesis to the pathogenesis of PCV. Findings from this research, together with improved diagnostic technology and new therapeutics, will facilitate more optimal management of Asian AMD.},

abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is a promising gene regulatory approach in functional genomics that has significant impact on crop improvement which permits down-regulation in gene expression with greater precise manner without affecting the expression of other genes. RNAi mechanism is expedited by small molecules of interfering RNA to suppress a gene of interest effectively. RNAi has also been exploited in plants for resistance against pathogens, insect/pest, nematodes, and virus that cause significant economic losses. Keeping beside the significance in the genome integrity maintenance as well as growth and development, RNAi induced gene syntheses are vital in plant stress management. Modifying the genes by the interference of small RNAs is one of the ways through which plants react to the environmental stresses. Hence, investigating the role of small RNAs in regulating gene expression assists the researchers to explore the potentiality of small RNAs in abiotic and biotic stress management. This novel approach opens new avenues for crop improvement by developing disease resistant, abiotic or biotic stress tolerant, and high yielding elite varieties.},

However, the high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data often complicate the analysis. Here, we introduce a method for analyzing scATAC-seq data, called Single-Cell ATAC-seq analysis via Latent feature Extraction (SCALE). SCALE combines a deep generative framework and a probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Model to learn latent features that accurately characterize scATAC-seq data. We validate SCALE on datasets generated on different platforms with different protocols, and having different overall data qualities. SCALE substantially outperforms the other tools in all aspects of scATAC-seq data analysis, including visualization, clustering, and denoising and imputation. Importantly, SCALE also generates interpretable features that directly link to cell populations, and can potentially reveal batch effects in scATAC-seq experiments.},

abstract = {Metabolomic data are frequently acquired using chromatographically coupled mass spectrometry (MS) platforms. For such datasets, the first step in data analysis relies on feature detection, where a feature is defined by a mass and retention time. While a feature typically is derived from a single compound, a spectrum of mass signals is more a more-accurate representation of the mass spectrometric signal for a given metabolite. Here, we report a novel feature grouping method that operates in an unsupervised manner to group signals from MS data into spectra without relying on predictability of the in-source phenomenon. We additionally address a fundamental bottleneck in metabolomics, annotation of MS level signals, by incorporating indiscriminant MS/MS (idMS/MS) data implicitly: feature detection is performed on both MS and idMS/MS data, and feature-feature relationships are determined simultaneously from the MS and idMS/MS data. This approach facilitates identification of metabolites using in-source MS and/or idMS/MS spectra from a single experiment, reduces quantitative analytical variation compared to single-feature measures, and decreases false positive annotations of unpredictable phenomenon as novel compounds. This tool is released as a freely available R package, called RAMClustR, and is sufficiently versatile to group features from any chromatographic-spectrometric platform or feature-finding software.},

Although the removal of this unwanted variation is a vital step in the analysis of metabolomics data, it is considered a gray area in which there is a recognized need to develop a better understanding of the procedures and statistical methods required to achieve statistically relevant optimal biological outcomes. In this paper, we discuss the causes of unwanted variation in metabolomics experiments, review commonly used metabolomics approaches for handling this unwanted variation, and present a statistical approach for the removal of unwanted variation to obtain normalized metabolomics data. The advantages and performance of the approach relative to several widely used metabolomics normalization approaches are illustrated through two metabolomics studies, and recommendations are provided for choosing and assessing the most suitable normalization method for a given metabolomics experiment.

abstract = {Supercentenarians, people who have reached 110 y of age, are a great model of healthy aging. Their characteristics of delayed onset of age-related diseases and compression of morbidity imply that their immune system remains functional. Here we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis of 61,202 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), derived from 7 supercentenarians and 5 younger controls. We identified a marked increase of cytotoxic CD4 T cells (CD4 cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTLs]) as a signature of supercentenarians. Furthermore, single-cell T cell receptor sequencing of 2 supercentenarians revealed that CD4 CTLs had accumulated through massive clonal expansion, with the most frequent clonotypes accounting for 15 to 35{\%} of the entire CD4 T cell population. The CD4 CTLs exhibited substantial heterogeneity in their degree of cytotoxicity as well as a nearly identical transcriptome to that of CD8 CTLs. This indicates that CD4 CTLs utilize the transcriptional program of the CD8 lineage while retaining CD4 expression. Indeed, CD4 CTLs extracted from supercentenarians produced IFN-$\gamma$ and TNF-$\alpha$ upon ex vivo stimulation. Our study reveals that supercentenarians have unique characteristics in their circulating lymphocytes, which may represent an essential adaptation to achieve exceptional longevity by sustaining immune responses to infections and diseases.},

Initial insight into the architecture of Argonautes came from studies of prokaryotic proteins, revealing a crescent-shaped base made up of the amino-terminal, PAZ, middle, and PIWI domains. The recently reported crystal structure of human Argonaute-2 (hAgo2), the "slicer" in RNA interference, in complex with a mixed population of RNAs derived from insect cells provides insight into the architecture of a eukaryotic Argonaute protein with defined biochemical and biological functions. Here, we report the structure of human Ago2 bound to a physiologically relevant microRNA, microRNA-20a, at 2.2 ?? resolution. The miRNA is anchored at both ends by the Mid and PAZ domains and makes several kinks and turns along the binding groove. Interestingly, miRNA binding confers remarkable stability on hAgo2, locking this otherwise flexible enzyme into a stable conformation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

To assess the effects of host and environmental factors on this condition, a study of 228 cases and 237 controls matched by age and sex, who had visited any of 34 Baltimore ophthalmologists between September 1, 1978 and March 31, 1980, was con- ducted. Study participants were interviewed for past medical, residential, oc- cupational, smoking and family histories, as well as social and demographic factors. Diagnoses were validated by means of fundus photographs. The 162 cases and 175 controls who met the study diagnostic criteria for cases and controls were included in the analysis. Statistically significant associations were demonstrated between senile macular degeneration and family history of macular disease (odds ratio (OR) = 2.9), chemical work exposures (OR = 4.2), blue or medium pigmented eyes (OR = 3.5), history of one or more cardiovas- cular diseases (OR = 1.7), decreased hand grip strength, and hyperopia. The risk of macular degeneration in cigarette smokers was significant for males only (OR = 2.6). The study results suggest that the development of macular degeneration is mainly influenced by familial, genetic, and personal charac- teristics, rather than by the few environmental factors studied. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate the role of environmental factors.},

Due to the importance of NBPs, the database was constructed based on manual curation and a newly developed pipeline utilizing both sequenced transcriptomes and genomes. In total the database has recorded 2.8 million of NBPs and their binding motifs from 662 NBP families and 2423 species, constituting the largest NBP database. ENPD covers evolutionarily important lineages which have never been included in the previous NBP databases, while lineage-specific NBP family expansions were also found. ENPD also focuses on the involvements of DBPs, RBPs and DRBPs in non-coding RNA (ncRNA) mediated gene regulation. The predicted and experimentally validated targets of NBPs have both been recorded and manually curated in ENPD, linking the interactions between ncRNAs, DNA regulatory elements and NBPs in gene regulation.

abstract = {Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors induce growth arrest and apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells. Sodium butyrate (NaB), a short chain fatty acid, is a HDAC inhibitor and is produced in the colonic lumen as a consequence of microbial degradation of dietary fibers. In order to dissect out the mechanism of NaB-induced growth inhibition of cancer cells, we carried out expression profiling of a human lung carcinoma cell line (H460) treated with NaB using a cDNA microarray. Of the total 1728 genes analysed, there were 32 genes with a mean expression value of 2.0-fold and higher and 66 genes with a mean expression value 3.0-fold and lower in NaB-treated cells. For a few selected genes, we demonstrate that their expression pattern by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis is matching with the results obtained by microarray analysis. Closer view at the expression profile of NaB-treated cells revealed the downregulation of a total of 16 genes associated with cytokine signaling, in particular, interferon gamma (IFNgamma) pathway. In good correlation, NaB-pretreated cells failed to induce interferon regulatory factor 1, an INFgamma target gene, efficiently upon IFNgamma addition. These results suggest that NaB inhibits proinflammatory cytokine signaling pathway, thus providing proof of mechanism for its anti-inflammatory activity. We also found that NaB induced three genes, which are known metastatic suppressors, and downregulated 11 genes, which have been shown to promote metastasis. Upregulation of metastatic suppressor Kangai 1 (KAI1) by NaB in a time-dependent manner was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. The differential regulation of metastasis-associated genes by NaB provides explanation for the anti-invasive properties of NaB. Therefore, our study presents new evidence for pathways regulated by NaB, thus providing evidence for the mechanism behind anti-inflammatory and antimetastatic activities of NaB.},

abstract = {High-dimensional single-cell technologies present new opportunities for biological discovery, but the complex nature of the resulting datasets makes it challenging to perform comprehensive analysis. One particular challenge is the analysis of single-cell time course datasets: how to identify unique cell populations and track how they change across time points. To facilitate this analysis, we developed FLOW-MAP, a graphical user interface (GUI)-based software tool that uses graph layout analysis with sequential time ordering to visualize cellular trajectories in high-dimensional single-cell datasets obtained from flow cytometry, mass cytometry or single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) experiments. Here we provide a detailed description of the FLOW-MAP algorithm and how to use the open-source R package FLOWMAPR via its GUI or with text-based commands. This approach can be applied to many dynamic processes, including in vitro stem cell differentiation, in vivo development, oncogenesis, the emergence of drug resistance and cell signaling dynamics. To demonstrate our approach, we perform a step-by-step analysis of a single-cell mass cytometry time course dataset from mouse embryonic stem cells differentiating into the three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. In addition, we demonstrate FLOW-MAP analysis of a previously published scRNAseq dataset. Using both synthetic and experimental datasets for comparison, we perform FLOW-MAP analysis side by side with other single-cell analysis methods, to illustrate when it is advantageous to use the FLOW-MAP approach. The protocol takes between 30 min and 1.5 h to complete.},

abstract = {Motivation: Understanding the occurrence and regulation of alternative splicing (AS) is a key task towards explaining the regulatory processes that help to shape the complex transcriptomes of higher eukaryotes. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing of RNA, the diversity of AS transcripts could be measured at an unprecedented depth. Although the catalog of known AS events has ever grown since, novel isoforms are commonly observed when working with less annotated organisms, in the context of diseases, or within large populations. Whereas an identification of complete isoforms is technically challenging or expensive, focussing on single splicing events as a proxy for transcriptome characteristics is fruitful for differential analyses. Results: We present SplAdder, an alternative splicing toolbox, that takes RNA-Seq alignments and an annotation file as input to i) augment the annotation based on RNA-Seq evidence, ii) identify alternative splicing events present in the augmented annotation graph, iii) quantify and confirm these events based on the RNA-Seq data, and iv) test for significant quantitative differences. Availability: Source code and documentation are available for download at github.com/ratschlab/spladder. Example data, introductory information and a small tutorial are accessible at bioweb.me/spladder.},

abstract = {P2X receptors are trimeric, non-selective cation channels activated by extracellular ATP. The P2X7 receptor subtype is a pharmacological target because of involvement in apoptotic, inflammatory, and tumor progression pathways. It is the most structurally and functionally distinct P2X subtype, containing a unique cytoplasmic domain critical for the receptor to initiate apoptosis and not undergo desensitization. However, lack of structural information about the cytoplasmic domain has hindered understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes. We report cryoelectron microscopy structures of full-length rat P2X7 receptor in apo and ATP-bound states. These structures reveal how one cytoplasmic element, the C-cys anchor, prevents desensitization by anchoring the pore-lining helix to the membrane with palmitoyl groups. They show a second cytoplasmic element with a unique fold, the cytoplasmic ballast, which unexpectedly contains a zinc ion complex and a guanosine nucleotide binding site. Our structures provide first insights into the architecture and function of a P2X receptor cytoplasmic domain.},

Here we map the transcriptional landscape of mouse bone marrow vascular, perivascular and osteoblast cell populations at single-cell resolution, both at homeostasis and under conditions of stress-induced haematopoiesis. This analysis revealed previously unappreciated levels of cellular heterogeneity within the bone marrow niche and resolved cellular sources of pro-haematopoietic growth factors, chemokines and membrane-bound ligands. Our studies demonstrate a considerable transcriptional remodelling of niche elements under stress conditions, including an adipocytic skewing of perivascular cells. Among the stress-induced changes, we observed that vascular Notch delta-like ligands (encoded by Dll1 and Dll4) were downregulated. In the absence of vascular Dll4, haematopoietic stem cells prematurely induced a myeloid transcriptional program. These findings refine our understanding of the cellular architecture of the bone marrow niche, reveal a dynamic and heterogeneous molecular landscape that is highly sensitive to stress and illustrate the utility of single-cell transcriptomic data in evaluating the regulation of haematopoiesis by discrete niche populations.},

@article{Levy2015,
abstract = {CRISPR-Cas (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats coupled with CRISPR-associated proteins) is a bacterial immunity system that protects against invading phages or plasmids. In the process of CRISPR adaptation, short pieces of DNA ('spacers') are acquired from foreign elements and integrated into the CRISPR array. So far, it has remained a mystery how spacers are preferentially acquired from the foreign DNA while the self chromosome is avoided. Here we show that spacer acquisition is replication-dependent, and that DNA breaks formed at stalled replication forks promote spacer acquisition. Chromosomal hotspots of spacer acquisition were confined by Chi sites, which are sequence octamers highly enriched on the bacterial chromosome, suggesting that these sites limit spacer acquisition from self DNA. We further show that the avoidance of self is mediated by the RecBCD double-stranded DNA break repair complex. Our results suggest that, in Escherichia coli, acquisition of new spacers largely depends on RecBCD-mediated processing of double-stranded DNA breaks occurring primarily at replication forks, and that the preference for foreign DNA is achieved through the higher density of Chi sites on the self chromosome, in combination with the higher number of forks on the foreign DNA. This model explains the strong preference to acquire spacers both from high copy plasmids and from phages.},

@article{Hsu2017,
abstract = {This paper introduces a novel method to perform transfer learning across domains and tasks, formulating it as a problem of learning to cluster. The key insight is that, in addition to features, we can transfer similarity information and this is sufficient to learn a similarity function and clustering network to perform both domain adaptation and cross-task transfer learning. We begin by reducing categorical information to pairwise constraints, which only considers whether two instances belong to the same class or not. This similarity is category-agnostic and can be learned from data in the source domain using a similarity network. We then present two novel approaches for performing transfer learning using this similarity function. First, for unsupervised domain adaptation, we design a new loss function to regularize classification with a constrained clustering loss, hence learning a clustering network with the transferred similarity metric generating the training inputs. Second, for cross-task learning (i.e., unsupervised clustering with unseen categories), we propose a framework to reconstruct and estimate the number of semantic clusters, again using the clustering network. Since the similarity network is noisy, the key is to use a robust clustering algorithm, and we show that our formulation is more robust than the alternative constrained and unconstrained clustering approaches. Using this method, we first show state of the art results for the challenging cross-task problem, applied on Omniglot and ImageNet. Our results show that we can reconstruct semantic clusters with high accuracy. We then evaluate the performance of cross-domain transfer using images from the Office-31 and SVHN-MNIST tasks and present top accuracy on both datasets. Our approach doesn't explicitly deal with domain discrepancy. If we combine with a domain adaptation loss, it shows further improvement.},

abstract = {The pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness worldwide, remains only partially understood. This has led to the current lack of accessible and reliable biofluid biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, and absence of treatments for dry AMD. This study aimed to assess the plasma metabolomic profiles of AMD and its severity stages with the ultimate goal of contributing to addressing these needs. We recruited two cohorts: Boston, United States (n = 196) and Coimbra, Portugal (n = 295). Fasting blood samples were analyzed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. For each cohort, we compared plasma metabolites of AMD patients versus controls (logistic regression), and across disease stages (permutation-based cumulative logistic regression considering both eyes). Meta-analyses were then used to combine results from the two cohorts. Our results revealed that 28 metabolites differed significantly between AMD patients versus controls (false discovery rate (FDR) q-value: 4.1 × 10−2–1.8 × 10−5), and 67 across disease stages (FDR q-value: 4.5 × 10−2–1.7 × 10−4). Pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of glycerophospholipid, purine, taurine and hypotaurine, and nitrogen metabolism (p-value ≤ 0.04). In conclusion, our findings support that AMD patients present distinct plasma metabolomic profiles, which vary with disease severity. This work contributes to the understanding of AMD pathophysiology, and can be the basis of future biomarkers and precision medicine for this blinding condition.},

XCMS2 is an open source software package which has been developed to automatically search tandem mass spec- trometry (MS/MS) data against high quality experimental MS/MS data from known metabolites contained in a reference library (METLIN). Scoring of hits is based on a “shared peak count” method that identifies masses of fragment ions shared between the analytical and reference MS/MS spectra. Another functional component ofXCMS2 is the capability of providing structural information for unknown metabolites, which are not in the METLIN database. This “similarity search” algorithm has been developed to detect possible structural motifs in the unknown metabolite which may produce characteristic fragment ions and neutral losses to related reference compounds contained in METLIN, even if the precursor masses are not the same.},

Each ofthese layers has a specific role in order to maintain the blood vessel diameter and to handle the changes in blood pressure. Interestingly, the blood vessel wall is lined with only one layer of endothelial cells. However, this single layer of cells is capable of releasing several relaxing factors including nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and hyperpolarizing factor that could promote vasodilation and decrease vascular resistance and blood pressure. Endothelial cells also release powerful contracting factors such as endothelin and thromboxane A2 with multiple targets in the blood vessels and other tissues, an important role in the control of the circulation, the hemodynamics, and cardiovascular and renal function. An imbalance between endothelium-derived vasodilators and vasoconstrictors could cause pathological changes that lead to major disorders such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes.},

abstract = {In brain, signaling mediated by cell adhesion molecules defines the identity and functional properties of synapses. The specificity of presynaptic and postsynaptic interactions that is presumably medi-ated by cell adhesion molecules suggests that there exists a logic that could explain neuronal connectivity at the molecular level. Despite its importance, however, the nature of such logic is poorly understood, and even basic parameters, such as the number, identity, and single-cell expression profiles of candidate synaptic cell adhesion molecules, are not known. Here, we devised a comprehensive list of genes involved in cell adhesion, and used single-cell RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to analyze their expression in electrophysiologically de-fined interneurons and projection neurons. We compared the cell type-specific expression of these genes with that of genes involved in transmembrane ion conductances (i.e., channels), exocytosis, and rho/rac signaling, which regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Using these data, we identified two independent, developmentally regu-lated networks of interacting genes encoding molecules involved in cell adhesion, exocytosis, and signal transduction. Our approach pro-vides a framework for a presumed cell adhesion and signaling code in neurons, enables correlating electrophysiological with molecular properties of neurons, and suggests avenues toward understanding synaptic specificity. synapse | cell adhesion | single cell | RNAseq T he brain's " connectivity code " is thought to confer exquisite specificity to brain circuits by dictating connectivity between different types of neurons. Although its existence has not yet been conclusively demonstrated, synaptic cell adhesion mole-cules likely comprise a large part of such a code (1–4). Cell ad-hesion molecules are encoded by ∼2{\%} of the genome and play central roles in all tissues. During brain development, precisely matching presynaptic and postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule interactions likely guide synapse formation and specify the properties of synapses by activating signal transduction cascades and recruiting scaffolding molecules, receptors, and active-zone proteins; in addition, such interactions could provide structural support to synapses. However, the molecular mechanisms in-volved are not understood. Because cell adhesion molecule-based interactions likely code for synapse specificity in a com-binatorial fashion (2, 3), an important step toward gaining insight into these molecular mechanisms is to eliminate nonfunctional possibilities, which—to a great extent—can be done by examin-ing cell type-specific expression of these molecules. If cell adhesion molecules dictate synapse properties, then such differences must be clearly present in interneuron and py-ramidal cell classes, which have diverse synaptic properties. For example, within the hippocampal circuit, CA1 pyramidal (CA1-PYR) neurons receive convergent inputs from multiple, elec-trophysiologically distinct inhibitory interneurons within the hippocampus (5). Inhibitory inputs include synapses formed by fast-spiking (FS) and regular-spiking (RS) interneurons (ref. 6; for reviews, see refs. 7 and 8). We previously showed using sin-gle-cell transcriptional profiling in FS parvalbumin (PV)-and RS cholecystokinin (CCK)-containing GABAergic interneurons that},

abstract = {“Sola dosis facit venenum.” These words of Paracelsus, “the dose makes the poison”, can lead to a cavalier attitude concerning potential toxicities of the vast array of low abundance environmental chemicals to which humans are exposed. Exposome research teaches that 80-85{\%} of human disease is linked to environmental exposures. The human exposome is estimated to include {\textgreater}400,000 environmental chemicals, most of which are uncharacterized with regard to human health. In fact, mass spectrometry measures {\textgreater}200,000 m/z features (ions) in microliter volumes derived from human samples; most are unidentified. This crystalizes a grand challenge for chemical research in toxicology: to develop reliable and affordable analytical methods to understand health impacts of the extensive human chemical experience. To this end, there appears to be no choice but to abandon the limitations of measuring one chemical at a time. The present article reviews progress in computational metabolomics to provide probability-based annotat...},

In developmental biology and stem cell studies, the ability to profile single cells confers particular benefits. Although most studies still focus on individual tissues or organs, the recent development of ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq has demonstrated potential power in characterizing more complex systems or even the entire body. However, although multiple ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems have attracted attention, no systematic comparison of these systems has been performed. Here, with the same cell line and bioinformatics pipeline, we developed directly comparable datasets for each of three widely used droplet-based ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems, inDrop, Drop-seq, and 10X Genomics Chromium. Although each system is capable of profiling single-cell transcriptomes, their detailed comparison revealed the distinguishing features and suitable applications for each system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Makarova2013,
abstract = {Our knowledge of prokaryotic defense systems has vastly expanded as the result of comparative genomic analysis, followed by experimental validation. This expansion is both quantitative, including the discovery of diverse new examples of known types of defense systems, such as restriction-modification or toxin-antitoxin systems, and qualitative, including the discovery of fundamentally new defense mechanisms, such as the CRISPR-Cas immunity system. Large-scale statistical analysis reveals that the distribution of different defense systems in bacterial and archaeal taxa is non-uniform, with four groups of organisms distinguishable with respect to the overall abundance and the balance between specific types of defense systems. The genes encoding defense system components in bacterial and archaea typically cluster in defense islands. In addition to genes encoding known defense systems, these islands contain numerous uncharacterized genes, which are candidates for new types of defense systems. The tight association of the genes encoding immunity systems and dormancy- or cell death-inducing defense systems in prokaryotic genomes suggests that these two major types of defense are functionally coupled, providing for effective protection at the population level.},

abstract = {The slicer activity of the RNA-induced silencing complex is associated with argonaute, the RNase H-like PIWI domain of which catalyses guide-strand-mediated sequence-specific cleavage of target messenger RNA. Here we report on the crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus argonaute bound to a 5'-phosphorylated 21-base DNA guide strand, thereby identifying the nucleic-acid-binding channel positioned between the PAZ- and PIWI-containing lobes, as well as the pivot-like conformational changes associated with complex formation. The bound guide strand is anchored at both of its ends, with the solvent-exposed Watson-Crick edges of stacked bases 2 to 6 positioned for nucleation with the mRNA target, whereas two critically positioned arginines lock bases 10 and 11 at the cleavage site into an unanticipated orthogonal alignment. Biochemical studies indicate that key amino acid residues at the active site and those lining the 5'-phosphate-binding pocket made up of the Mid domain are critical for cleavage activity, whereas alterations of residues lining the 2-nucleotide 3'-end-binding pocket made up of the PAZ domain show little effect.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors The retina is a specialized neural tissue that senses light and initiates image processing. Although the functional organization of specific retina cells has been well studied, the molecular profile of many cell types remains unclear in humans. To comprehensively profile the human retina, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 20,009 cells from three donors and compiled a reference transcriptome atlas. Using unsupervised clustering analysis, we identified 18 transcriptionally distinct cell populations representing all known neural retinal cells: rod photoreceptors, cone photoreceptors, M{\"{u}}ller glia, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells, astrocytes, and microglia. Our data captured molecular profiles for healthy and putative early degenerating rod photoreceptors, and revealed the loss of MALAT1 expression with longer post-mortem time, which potentially suggested a novel role of MALAT1 in rod photoreceptor degeneration. We have demonstrated the use of this retina transcriptome atlas to benchmark pluripotent stem cell-derived cone photoreceptors and an adult M{\"{u}}ller glia cell line. This work provides an important reference with unprecedented insights into the transcriptional landscape of human retinal cells, which is fundamental to understanding retinal biology and disease.},

abstract = {? 2014, The Author(s).Phenotyping of 1,200 ?healthy? adults from the UK has been performed through the investigation of diverse classes of hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites present in serum by applying a series of chromatography?mass spectrometry platforms. These data were made robust to instrumental drift by numerical correction; this was prerequisite to allow detection of subtle metabolic differences. The variation in observed metabolite relative concentrations between the 1,200 subjects ranged from less than 5?{\%} to more than 200?{\%}. Variations in metabolites could be related to differences in gender, age, BMI, blood pressure, and smoking. Investigations suggest that a sample size of 600 subjects is both necessary and sufficient for robust analysis of these data. Overall, this is a large scale and non-targeted chromatographic MS-based metabolomics study, using samples from over 1,000 individuals, to provide a comprehensive measurement of their serum metabolomes. This work provides an important baseline or reference dataset for understanding the ?normal? relative concentrations and variation in the human serum metabolome. These may be related to our increasing knowledge of the human metabolic network map. Information on the Husermet study is available at http://www.husermet.org/. Importantly, all of the data are made freely available at MetaboLights (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/).},

abstract = {Gene silencing through RNA interference (RNAi) is carried out by RISC, the RNA-induced silencing complex. RISC contains two signature components, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and Argonaute family proteins. Here, we show that the multiple Argonaute proteins present in mammals are both biologically and biochemically distinct, with a single mammalian family member, Argonaute2, being responsible for messenger RNA cleavage activity. This protein is essential for mouse development, and cells lacking Argonaute2 are unable to mount an experimental response to siRNAs. Mutations within a cryptic ribonuclease H domain within Argonaute2, as identified by comparison with the structure of an archeal Argonaute protein, inactivate RISC. Thus, our evidence supports a model in which Argonaute contributes "Slicer" activity to RISC, providing the catalytic engine for RNAi.},

The main advantage of scRNA-seq is that the cellular resolution and the genome wide scope makes it possible to address issues that are intractable using other methods, e.g. bulk RNA-seq or single-cell RT-qPCR. However, to analyze scRNA-seq data, novel methods are required and some of the underlying assumptions for the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid. In this course we will discuss some of the questions that can be addressed using scRNA-seq as well as the available computational and statistical methods avialable. The course is taught through the University of Cambridge Bioinformatics training unit, but the material found on these pages is meant to be used for anyone interested in learning about computational analysis of scRNA-seq data. The course is taught twice per year and the material here is updated prior to each event. The number of computational tools is increasing rapidly and we are doing our best to keep up to date with what is available. One of the main constraints for this course is that we would like to use tools that are implemented in R and that run reasonably fast. Moreover, we will also confess to being somewhat biased towards methods that have been developed either by us or by our friends and colleagues.},

abstract = {The spontaneous deamination of cytosine is a major source of C•G to T•A transitions, which account for half of known human pathogenic point mutations. The ability to efficiently convert target A•T base pairs to G•C could therefore advance the study and treatment of genetic diseases. While the deamination of adenine yields inosine, which is treated as guanine by polymerases, no enzymes are known to deaminate adenine in DNA. Here we report adenine base editors (ABEs) that mediate conversion of A•T to G•C in genomic DNA. We evolved a tRNA adenosine deaminase to operate on DNA when fused to a catalytically impaired CRISPR-Cas9. Extensive directed evolution and protein engineering resulted in seventh- generation ABEs ( e.g. , ABE7.10), that convert target A•T to G•C base pairs efficiently ( {\~{}} 50{\%} in human cells) with very high product purity (typically ≥ 99.9{\%}) and very low rates of indels (typically ≤ 0.1{\%}). ABEs introduce point mutations more efficiently and cleanly than a current Cas9 nuclease-based method, induce less off-target genome modification than Cas9, and can install disease-correcting or disease-suppressing mutations in human cells. Together with our previous base editors, ABEs advance genome editing by enabling the direct, programmable introduction of all four transition mutations without double-stranded DNA cleavage.},

abstract = {Cultivated mammalian cells have become the dominant system for the production of recombinant proteins for clinical applications because of their capacity for proper protein folding, assembly and post-translational modification. Thus, the quality and efficacy of a protein can be superior when expressed in mammalian cells versus other hosts such as bacteria, plants and yeast. Recently, the productivity of mammalian cells cultivated in bioreactors has reached the gram per liter range in a number of cases, a more than 100-fold yield improvement over titers seen for similar processes in the mid-1980s. This increase in volumetric productivity has resulted mainly from improvements in media composition and process control. Opportunities still exist for improving mammalian cell systems through further advancements in production systems as well as through vector and host cell engineering.},

abstract = {Introduction: The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent and morphology of the choriocapillaris' density defect in patients with drusen in non-neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: Participants in this study were 36 patients with non-neovascular AMD and drusen. All patients underwent best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Results: In all studied cases, the presence of drusen was associated with choriocapillaris' reduced blood flow signal of different extent and severity. Three types of choriocapillaris' non-perfusion were observed, along with an association between the size of drusen and the morphology of choriocapillaris' density defect. Moreover, the extent of choriocapillaris' density change has been related to ellipsoid zone disruption and therefore to visual impairment. Conclusions: Our study showed that in patients with drusen due to non-neovascular AMD, there is choriocapillaris' impairment of different morphology in OCTA, which is mainly related to the size and location of the drusen.},

Understanding the regulation of these processes requires sensitive and specific detection of differential isoform abun- dance in comparisons between conditions, cell types, or tissues. We present DEXSeq, a statistical method to test for dif- ferential exon usage in RNA-seq data. DEXSeq uses generalized linear models and offers reliable control of false discoveries by taking biological variation into account. DEXSeq detects with high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that are subject to differential exon usage. We demonstrate the versatility of DEXSeq by applying it to several data sets. The method facilitates the study of regulation and function of alternative exon usage on a genome-wide scale. An implementation of DEXSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor package.},

abstract = {Bacteriophages (phages) specifically infect bacteria and are the most abundant biological entities on Earth. The constant exposure to phage infection imposes a strong selective pressure on bacteria to develop viral resistance strategies that promote prokaryotic survival. Thus, this parasite-host relationship results in an evolutionary arms race of adaptation and counteradaptation between the interacting partners. The evolutionary outcome is a spectrum of remarkable strategies used by the bacteria and phages as they attempt to coexist. These approaches include adsorption inhibition, injection blocking, abortive infection, toxin-antitoxin, and CRISPR-Cas systems. In this review, we highlight the diverse and complementary antiphage systems in bacteria, as well as the evasion mechanisms used by phages to escape these resistance strategies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications. RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

abstract = {Since their discovery, giant viruses have revealed several unique features that challenge the conventional definition of a virus, such as their large and complex genomes, their infection by virophages and their presence of transferable short element transpovirons. Here we investigate the sensitivity of mimivirus to virophage infection in a collection of 59 viral strains and demonstrate lineage specificity in the resistance of mimivirus to Zamilon, a unique virophage that can infect lineages B and C of mimivirus but not lineage A. We hypothesized that mimiviruses harbour a defence mechanism resembling the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas system that is widely present in bacteria and archaea. We performed de novo sequencing of 45 new mimivirus strains and searched for sequences specific to Zamilon in a total of 60 mimivirus genomes. We found that lineage A strains are resistant to Zamilon and contain the insertion of a repeated Zamilon sequence within an operon, here named the 'mimivirus virophage resistance element' (MIMIVIRE). Further analyses of the surrounding sequences showed that this locus is reminiscent of a defence mechanism related to the CRISPR-Cas system. Silencing the repeated sequence and the MIMIVIRE genes restores mimivirus susceptibility to Zamilon. The MIMIVIRE proteins possess the typical functions (nuclease and helicase) involved in the degradation of foreign nucleic acids. The viral defence system, MIMIVIRE, represents a nucleic-acid-based immunity against virophage infection.},

@article{Leveillard2019,
abstract = {The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood–retina barrier and facilitates the transepithelial transport of glucose into the outer retina via GLUT1. Glucose is metabolized in photoreceptors via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) but also by aerobic glycolysis to generate glycerol for the synthesis of phospholipids for the renewal of their outer segments. Aerobic glycolysis in the photoreceptors also leads to a high rate of production of lactate which is transported out of the subretinal space to the choroidal circulation by the RPE. Lactate taken up by the RPE is converted to pyruvate and metabolized via OXPHOS. Excess lactate in the RPE is transported across the basolateral membrane to the choroid. The uptake of glucose by cone photoreceptor cells is enhanced by rod-derived cone viability factor (RdCVF) secreted by rods and by insulin signaling. Together, the three cells act as symbiotes: the RPE supplies the glucose from the choroidal circulation to the photoreceptors, the rods help the cones, and both produce lactate to feed the RPE. In age-related macular degeneration this delicate m{\'{e}}nage {\`{a}} trois is disturbed by the chronic infiltration of inflammatory macrophages. These immune cells also rely on aerobic glycolysis and compete for glucose and produce lactate. We here review the glucose metabolism in the homeostasis of the outer retina and in macrophages and hypothesize what happens when the metabolism of photoreceptors and the RPE is disturbed by chronic inflammation.},

Determining the boundaries, centres and intensities of the two-dimensional signals in the LC/MS raw data is called feature detection. For the subsequent analysis of complex samples such as plant extracts, which may contain hundreds of compounds, corresponding to thousands of features - a reliable feature detection is mandatory.RESULTS:We developed a new feature detection algorithm "centWave" for high-resolution LC/MS data sets, which collects regions of interest (partial mass traces) in the raw-data, and applies continuous wavelet transformation and optionally Gauss-fitting in the chromatographic domain. We evaluated our feature detection algorithm on dilution series and mixtures of seed and leaf extracts, and estimated recall, precision and F-score of seed and leaf specific features in two experiments of different complexity. CONCLUSIONS:The new feature detection algorithm meets the requirements of current metabolomics experiments. centWave can detect close-by and partially overlapping features and has the highest overall recall and precision values compared to the other algorithms, matchedFilter (the original algorithm of XCMS) and the centroidPicker from MZmine.

abstract = {Drusen are extracellular deposits that accumulate below the retinal pigment epithelium on Bruch's membrane and are risk factors for developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The progression of AMD might be slowed or halted if the formation of drusen could be modulated. To work toward a molecular understanding of drusen formation, we have developed a method for isolating microgram quantities of drusen and Bruch's membrane for proteome analysis. Liquid chromatography tandem MS analyses of drusen preparations from 18 normal donors and five AMD donors identified 129 proteins. Immunocytochemical studies have thus far localized ≈16{\%} of these proteins in drusen. Tissue metalloproteinase inhibitor 3, clusterin, vitronectin, and serum albumin were the most common proteins observed in normal donor drusen whereas crystallin was detected more frequently in AMD donor drusen. Up to 65{\%} of the proteins identified were found in drusen from both AMD and normal donors. However, oxidative protein modifications were also observed, including apparent crosslinked species of tissue metalloproteinase inhibitor 3 and vitronectin, and carboxyethyl pyrrole protein adducts. Carboxyethyl pyrrole adducts are uniquely generated from the oxidation of docosahexaenoate-containing lipids. By Western analysis they were found to be more abundant in AMD than in normal Bruch's membrane and were found associated with drusen proteins. Carboxymethyl lysine, another oxidative modification, was also detected in drusen. These data strongly support the hypothesis that oxidative injury contributes to the pathogenesis of AMD and suggest that oxidative protein modifications may have a critical role in drusen formation.},

abstract = {Lineage studies conducted in the retina more than 25 years ago demonstrated the multipotency of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). The number and types of cells produced by individual RPCs, even from a single time point in development, were found to be highly variable. This raised the question of whether this variability was due to intrinsic differences among RPCs or to extrinsic and/or stochastic effects on equivalent RPCs or their progeny. Newer lineage studies that have made use of molecular markers of RPCs, retrovirus-mediated lineage analyses of specific RPCs and live imaging have begun to provide answers to this question. RPCs that produce two postmitotic daughter cells-that is, terminally dividing RPCs-have been the most well characterized RPCs to date, and have been shown to produce specific types of daughter cells. In addition, recent studies have begun to shed light on the mechanisms that drive the temporal order in which retinal cells are born. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and their associated proteins (CRISPR/Cas) constitute a recently identified prokaryotic defense mechanism against invading nucleic acids. Activity of the CRISPR/Cas system comprises of three steps: (i) insertion of alien DNA sequences into the CRISPR array to prevent future attacks, in a process called 'adaptation', (ii) expression of the relevant proteins, as well as expression and processing of the array, followed by (iii) RNA-mediated interference with the alien nucleic acid. Here we describe a robust assay in Escherichia coli to explore the hitherto least-studied process, adaptation. We identify essential genes and DNA elements in the leader sequence and in the array which are essential for the adaptation step. We also provide mechanistic insights on the insertion of the repeat-spacer unit by showing that the first repeat serves as the template for the newly inserted repeat. Taken together, our results elucidate fundamental steps in the adaptation process of the CRISPR/Cas system.},

abstract = {Pseudotargeted metabolic profiling is a novel strategy combining the advantages of both targeted and untargeted methods. The strategy obtains metabolites and their product ions from quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS by information-dependent acquisition (IDA) and then picks targeted ion pairs and measures them on a triple-quadrupole MS by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The picking of ion pairs from thousands of candidates is the most time-consuming step of the pseudotargeted strategy. Herein, a systematic and automated approach and software (MRM-Ion Pair Finder) were developed to acquire characteristic MRM ion pairs by precursor ions alignment, MS(2) spectrum extraction and reduction, characteristic product ion selection, and ion fusion. To test the reliability of the approach, a mixture of 15 metabolite standards was first analyzed; the representative ion pairs were correctly picked out. Then, pooled serum samples were further studied, and the results were confirmed by the manual selection. Finally, a comparison with a commercial peak alignment software was performed, and a good characteristic ion coverage of metabolites was obtained. As a proof of concept, the proposed approach was applied to a metabolomics study of liver cancer; 854 metabolite ion pairs were defined in the positive ion mode from serum. Our approach provides a high throughput method which is reliable to acquire MRM ion pairs for pseudotargeted metabolomics with improved metabolite coverage and facilitate more reliable biomarkers discoveries.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Background: Numerous population-based studies of age-related macular degeneration have been reported around the world, with the results of some studies suggesting racial or ethnic differences in disease prevalence. Integrating these resources to provide summarised data to establish worldwide prevalence and to project the number of people with age-related macular degeneration from 2020 to 2040 would be a useful guide for global strategies. Methods: We did a systematic literature review to identify all population-based studies of age-related macular degeneration published before May, 2013. Only studies using retinal photographs and standardised grading classifications (the Wisconsin age-related maculopathy grading system, the international classification for age-related macular degeneration, or the Rotterdam staging system) were included. Hierarchical Bayesian approaches were used to estimate the pooled prevalence, the 95{\%} credible intervals (CrI), and to examine the difference in prevalence by ethnicity (European, African, Hispanic, Asian) and region (Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, North America, and Oceania). UN World Population Prospects were used to project the number of people affected in 2014 and 2040. Bayes factor was calculated as a measure of statistical evidence, with a score above three indicating substantial evidence. Findings: Analysis of 129664 individuals (aged 30-97 years), with 12727 cases from 39 studies, showed the pooled prevalence (mapped to an age range of 45-85 years) of early, late, and any age-related macular degeneration to be 8{\textperiodcentered}01{\%} (95{\%} CrI 3{\textperiodcentered}98-15{\textperiodcentered}49), 0{\textperiodcentered}37{\%} (0{\textperiodcentered}18-0{\textperiodcentered}77), and 8{\textperiodcentered}69{\%} (4{\textperiodcentered}26-17{\textperiodcentered}40), respectively. We found a higher prevalence of early and any age-related macular degeneration in Europeans than in Asians (early: 11{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} vs 6{\textperiodcentered}8{\%}, Bayes factor 3{\textperiodcentered}9; any: 12{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} vs 7{\textperiodcentered}4{\%}, Bayes factor 4{\textperiodcentered}3), and early, late, and any age-related macular degeneration to be more prevalent in Europeans than in Africans (early: 11{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} vs 7{\textperiodcentered}1{\%}, Bayes factor 12{\textperiodcentered}2; late: 0{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} vs 0{\textperiodcentered}3{\%}, 3{\textperiodcentered}7; any: 12{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} vs 7{\textperiodcentered}5{\%}, 31{\textperiodcentered}3). There was no difference in prevalence between Asians and Africans (all Bayes factors {\textless}1). Europeans had a higher prevalence of geographic atrophy subtype (1{\textperiodcentered}11{\%}, 95{\%} CrI 0{\textperiodcentered}53-2{\textperiodcentered}08) than Africans (0{\textperiodcentered}14{\%}, 0{\textperiodcentered}04-0{\textperiodcentered}45), Asians (0{\textperiodcentered}21{\%}, 0{\textperiodcentered}04-0{\textperiodcentered}87), and Hispanics (0{\textperiodcentered}16{\%}, 0{\textperiodcentered}05-0{\textperiodcentered}46). Between geographical regions, cases of early and any age-related macular degeneration were less prevalent in Asia than in Europe and North America (early: 6{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} vs 14.3{\%} and 12{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} [Bayes factor 2{\textperiodcentered}3 and 7{\textperiodcentered}6]; any: 6{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} vs 18{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} and 14{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} [3{\textperiodcentered}0 and 3{\textperiodcentered}8]). No significant gender effect was noted in prevalence (Bayes factor {\textless}1{\textperiodcentered}0). The projected number of people with age-related macular degeneration in 2020 is 196 million (95{\%} CrI 140-261), increasing to 288 million in 2040 (205-399). Interpretation: These estimates indicate the substantial global burden of age-related macular degeneration. Summarised data provide information for understanding the effect of the condition and provide data towards designing eye-care strategies and health services around the world.

They are increasingly being sought as environmentally friendly and cost-effective alternatives to conventional catalysts used in industries ranging from bioremediation to applications in medicine and pharmaceutics. Despite the benefits, they are not without their limitations. Many naturally occurring enzymes are not suitable for use outside of their native cellular environments. However, protein engineering can be used to generate enzymes tailored for specific industrial applications. Directed evolution is particularly useful and can be employed even when lack of structural information impedes the use of rational design. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of current industrial applications of enzyme technology and to show how directed evolution can be used to modify and to enhance enzyme properties. This includes a brief discussion on library generation and a more detailed focus on library screening methods, which are critical to any directed evolution experiment.},

abstract = {PURPOSE. To determine the pattern of drusen accumulation with age and to investigate the initial sites of deposition and their relationship to choroidal capillaries in human donor eyes from the eye bank of Moorfields Eye Hospital. METHODS. Wholemounted, hydrated preparations of the chorioc{\`{a}}pillaris and Bruch's membrane from donor eyes ranging from 42 to 95 years, with or without retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), were examined by conventional and confocal microscopy. Drusen were visualized by their autofluorescence. RESULTS. In all age groups studied autofluorescent drusen were present at the equator but were not found centrally where the vascular architecture is different, being tubular rather than a honeycomb pattern. Autofluorescing drusen were strongly associated with the lateral walls of the choriocapillaris (an area commonly known as the intercapillary pillars of the choriocapillaris (P = 0.028; Wilcoxon signed ranks test). Nonfluorescing drusen were occasionally seen centrally, but were not easily identified, and because of their large size, their localization with respect to capillary walls was not possible. CONCLUSIONS. These results strongly support the notion that autofluorescent drusen are not randomly distributed and have a specific spatial relationship to choroidal vessel walls. That equatorial drusen fluoresce, whereas central drusen do not, suggests that they may have different chemical compositions at the two sites and possibly different significance in age-related macular disease.},

In GraDeR, glycerol gradient centrifugation is used for the mild removal of free detergent monomers and micelles from lauryl maltose-neopentyl glycol detergent stabilized membrane complexes, resulting in monodisperse and stable complexes to which standard processes for water-soluble complexes can be applied. We demonstrate the applicability of the method on three different membrane complexes, including the mammalian FoF1 ATP synthase. For this highly dynamic and fragile rotary motor, we show that GraDeR allows visualizing the asymmetry of the F1 domain, which matches the ground state structure of the isolated domain. Therefore, the present cryo-EM structure of FoF1 ATP synthase provides direct structural evidence for Boyer's binding change mechanism in the context of the intact enzyme.},

abstract = {Continuing improvements in analytical technology along with an increased interest in performing comprehensive, quantitative metabolic profiling, is leading to increased interest pressures within the metabolomics community to develop centralized metabolite reference resources for certain clinically important biofluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid, urine and blood. As part of an ongoing effort to systematically characterize the human metabolome through the Human Metabolome Project, we have undertaken the task of characterizing the human serum metabolome. In doing so, we have combined targeted and non-targeted NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS methods with computer-aided literature mining to identify and quantify a comprehensive, if not absolutely complete, set of metabolites commonly detected and quantified (with today's technology) in the human serum metabolome. Our use of multiple metabolomics platforms and technologies allowed us to substantially enhance the level of metabolome coverage while critically assessing the relative strengths and weaknesses of these platforms or technologies.

To accelerate the understanding of AMD biology and help design new therapies, we executed a collaborative genome-wide association study, including {\textgreater}17,100 advanced AMD cases and {\textgreater}60,000 controls of European and Asian ancestry. We identified 19 loci associated at P {\textless} 5 × 10 -8. These loci show enrichment for genes involved in the regulation of complement activity, lipid metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis. Our results include seven loci with associations reaching P {\textless} 5 × 10-8 for the first time, near the genes COL8A1-FILIP1L, IER3-DDR1, SLC16A8, TGFBR1, RAD51B, ADAMTS9 and B3GALTL. A genetic risk score combining SNP genotypes from all loci showed similar ability to distinguish cases and controls in all samples examined. Our findings provide new directions for biological, genetic and therapeutic studies of AMD.},

The promise of this technology is attracting a growing user base for single-cell analysis methods. As more analysis tools are becoming available, it is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate this landscape and produce an up-to-date workflow to analyse one's data. Here, we detail the steps of a typical single-cell RNA-seq analysis, including pre-processing (quality control, normalization, data correction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction) and cell- and gene-level downstream analysis. We formulate current best-practice recommendations for these steps based on independent comparison studies. We have integrated these best-practice recommendations into a workflow, which we apply to a public dataset to further illustrate how these steps work in practice. Our documented case study can be found at https://www.github.com/theislab/single-cell-tutorial This review will serve as a workflow tutorial for new entrants into the field, and help established users update their analysis pipelines.},

Existing scRNA-seq analysis methods incorrectly assume that the composition of cell populations is either known or identical across batches. We present a strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on predefined or equal population compositions across batches; instead, it requires only that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with existing methods by using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets. Using multiple droplet-based scRNA-seq data sets, we demonstrate that our MNN batch-effect-correction method can be scaled to large numbers of cells.},

Using this approach, we establish a normal epigenetic baseline for healthy blood development, which we then use to deconvolve aberrant molecular features within blood from patients with mixed-phenotype acute leukemia4,5. Despite widespread epigenetic heterogeneity within the patient cohort, we observe common malignant signatures across patients as well as patient-specific regulatory features that are shared across phenotypic compartments of individual patients. Integrative analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin-accessibility maps identified 91,601 putative peak-to-gene linkages and transcription factors that regulate leukemia-specific genes, such as RUNX1-linked regulatory elements proximal to the marker gene CD69. These results demonstrate how integrative, multiomic analysis of single cells within the framework of normal development can reveal both distinct and shared molecular mechanisms of disease from patient samples.},

Although the C-terminal portion of P2X7 is thought to be essential for multiple receptor functions, little is known regarding the structural motifs that lie within this region. We show here that the P2X7 C-terminal domain contains several apparent protein-protein and protein-lipid interaction motifs with potential importance to macrophage signaling and LPS action. Surprisingly, P2X7 also contains a conserved LPS-binding domain. In this report, we demonstrate that peptides derived from this P2X7 sequence bind LPS in vitro. Moreover, these peptides neutralize the ability of LPS to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1, ERK2) and to promote the degradation of the inhibitor of kappaB-alpha isoform (IkappaB-alpha) in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Collectively, these data suggest that the C-terminal domain of P2X7 may directly coordinate several signal transduction events related to macrophage function and LPS action.},

This has been attributed to mechanical forces, such as urine flow, that prevent the ascent of bladder microbes. Here, we show that the regional hypersalinity, required for the kidney's urine-concentrating function, instructs epithelial cells to produce chemokines that localize monocyte-derived mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to the medulla. This hypersaline environment also increases the intrinsic bactericidal and neutrophil chemotactic activities of MNPs to generate a zone of defense. Because MNP positioning and function are dynamically regulated by the renal salt gradient, we find that patients with urinary concentrating defects are susceptible to kidney infection. Our work reveals a critical accessory role for the homeostatic function of a vital organ in optimizing tissue defense.},

AS events detected in the brain are more highly conserved than those detected in other tissues, suggesting that they more often provide conserved functions. Our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of neural AS events has significantly advanced with the coupling of various computational and experimental approaches. These studies indicate that dynamic regulation of AS in the nervous system is critical for modulating protein-protein interactions, transcription networks, and multiple aspects of neuronal development. Furthermore, several underappreciated classes of AS with the aforementioned roles in neuronal cells have emerged from unbiased, global approaches. Collectively, these findings emphasize the importance of characterizing neural AS in order to gain new insight into pathways that may be altered in neurological diseases and disorders.},

abstract = {Forensic and clinical toxicological screening procedures are employing liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques with information-dependent acquisition (IDA) approaches more and more often. It is known that the complexity of a sample and the IDA settings might prevent important compounds from being triggered. Therefore, data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods should be more suitable for systematic toxicological analysis (STA). The DIA method sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment-ion spectra (SWATH), which uses Q1 windows of 20−35 Da for data-independent fragmentation, was systematically investigated for its suitability for STA. Quality of SWATH- generated mass spectra were evaluated with regard to mass error, relative abundance of the fragments, and library hits. With the Q1 window set to 20−25 Da, several precursors pass Q1 at the same time and are fragmented, thus impairing the library search algorithms to a different extent: forward fit was less affected than reverse fit and purity fit. Mass error was not affected. The relative abundance of the fragments was concentration dependent for some analytes and was influenced by cofragmentation, especially of deuterated analogues. Also, the detection rate of IDA compared to SWATH was investigated in a forced coelution experiment (up to 20 analytes coeluting). Even using several different IDA settings, it was observed that IDA failed to trigger relevant compounds. Screening results of 382 authentic forensic cases revealed that SWATH's detection rate was superior to IDA, which failed to trigger ∼10{\%} of the analytes.},

abstract = {Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying natural variation in gene expression is a central goal of both medical and evolutionary genetics, and studies of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have become an important tool for achieving this goal. Although all eQTL studies so far have assayed messenger RNA levels using expression microarrays, recent advances in RNA sequencing enable the analysis of transcript variation at unprecedented resolution. We sequenced RNA from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated Nigerian individuals that have been extensively genotyped by the International HapMap Project. By pooling data from all individuals, we generated a map of the transcriptional landscape of these cells, identifying extensive use of unannotated untranslated regions and more than 100 new putative protein-coding exons. Using the genotypes from the HapMap project, we identified more than a thousand genes at which genetic variation influences overall expression levels or splicing. We demonstrate that eQTLs near genes generally act by a mechanism involving allele-specific expression, and that variation that influences the inclusion of an exon is enriched within and near the consensus splice sites. Our results illustrate the power of high-throughput sequencing for the joint analysis of variation in transcription, splicing and allele-specific expression across individuals.},

abstract = {P2X receptors are cation selective ion channels gated by extracellular ATP and implicated in diverse physiological processes, from synaptic transmission to inflammation to the sensing of taste and pain. Because P2X receptors are not related to other ion channel proteins of known structure, there is presently no molecular foundation for mechanisms of ligand-gating, allosteric modulation and ion permeation. Here we present crystal structures of the zebrafish P2X4 receptor in its closed, resting state. The chalice-shaped, trimeric receptor is knit together by subunit-subunit contacts implicated in ion channel gating and receptor assembly. Extracellular domains, rich in $\beta$-strands, have large acidic patches that may attract cations, through fenestrations, to vestibules near the ion channel. Within the transmembrane pore, the ‘gate' is defined by an {\~{}}8 Ǻ slab of protein. We define the location of three non-canonical, intersubunit ATP binding sites and suggest that ATP binding promotes subunit rearrangement and ion channel opening.},

abstract = {Cell signaling is a fast, dynamic, and complex process, which controls a variety of critical physiological functions. Methods to investigate such dynamic information, however, suffer from limited throughput in the single-cell level and a lack of precise fluid manipulation. Herein, we present a new strategy, termed dynamic microfluidic cytometry (DMC), for high-throughput probing of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling in single-cell resolution (single-cell cellomics analysis) by creatively applied cyclical cell trapping, stimulating, and releasing automatically. Dose–response curves and half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values for HeLa cells treated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP), histamine (HA), and acetylcholine chloride (ACH) were successfully obtained in the single-cell level. High-throughput single-cell dynamic signaling was further implemented by sequential or simultaneous stimulation, which revealed that different mechanisms were working in triggering intracellular calcium release. In addition, simultaneous stimulation to two different types of cells, HeLa and NIH-3T3 cells, was also successfully realized, which was crucial for online comparison of dynamic signaling of different types of cells. We believe that the proposed DMC provides a versatile means for high-throughput probing single-cell dynamic signaling, which is potentially useful in chemical biology, cell biology, and pharmacology.},

abstract = {Elucidation of regulatory networks, including identification of regulatory mechanisms specific to a given biological context, is a key aim in systems biology. This has motivated the move from co-expression to differential co-expression analysis and numerous methods have been developed subsequently to address this task; however, evaluation of methods and interpretation of the resulting networks has been hindered by the lack of known context-specific regulatory interactions. In this study, we develop a simulator based on dynamical systems modelling capable of simulating differential co-expression patterns. With the simulator and an evaluation framework, we benchmark and characterise the performance of inference methods. Defining three different levels of “true” networks for each simulation, we show that accurate inference of causation is difficult for all methods, compared to inference of associations. We show that a z-score-based method has the best general performance. Further, analysis of simulation parameters reveals five network and simulation properties that explained the performance of methods. The evaluation framework and inference methods used in this study are available in the dcanr R/Bioconductor package. Our analysis of networks inferred from simulated data show that hub nodes are more likely to be differentially regulated targets than transcription factors. Based on this observation, we propose an interpretation of the inferred differential network that can reconstruct a putative causal network.},

An important facet of these studies is the ability to identify the transcriptional signatures that define a cell type or state. In theory, this information can be used to classify an individual cell based on its transcriptional profile. Here, we present scPred, a new generalizable method that is able to provide highly accurate classification of single cells, using a combination of unbiased feature selection from a reduced-dimension space, and machine-learning probability-based prediction method. We apply scPred to scRNA-seq data from pancreatic tissue, mononuclear cells, colorectal tumor biopsies, and circulating dendritic cells and show that scPred is able to classify individual cells with high accuracy.

abstract = {The major cell classes of the brain differ in their developmental processes, metabolism, signaling, and function. To better understand the functions and interactions of the cell types that comprise these classes, we acutely purified representative populations of neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, newly formed oligodendrocytes, myelinating oligodendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, and pericytes from mouse cerebral cortex. We generated a transcriptome database for these eight cell types by RNA sequencing and used a sensitive algorithm to detect alternative splicing events in each cell type. Bioinformatic analyses identified thousands of new cell type-enriched genes and splicing isoforms that will provide novel markers for cell identification, tools for genetic manipulation, and insights into the biology of the brain. For example, our data provide clues as to how neurons and astrocytes differ in their ability to dynamically regulate glycolytic flux and lactate generation attributable to unique splicing of PKM2, the gene encoding the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. This dataset will provide a powerful new resource for understanding the development and function of the brain. To ensure the widespread distribution of these datasets, we have created a user-friendly website (http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres{\_}lab/brain{\_}rnaseq.html) that provides a platform for analyzing and comparing transciption and alternative splicing profiles for various cell classes in the brain.},

Moreover, this is the first example in which the near atomic resolution structure of an integral membrane protein was elucidated by this technique and in a manner not requiring crystals, demonstrating the transformative power of single particle cryo-EM for revealing high-resolution structures of integral membrane proteins, particularly those of mammalian origin.

While there are numerous studies investigating the non-coding transcriptome of retina and RPE, few significant differences between AMD and normal tissues have been reported. Strand specific RNA sequencing of both peripheral retina (PR) and RPE-Choroid-Sclera (PRCS), in both AMD and matched normal controls were generated. The transcriptome analysis reveals a highly significant and consistent impact on anti-sense transcription as well as moderate changes in the regulation of non-coding (sense) RNA. Hundreds of genes that do not express anti-sense transcripts in normal PR and PRCS demonstrate significant anti-sense expression in AMD in all patient samples. Several pathways are highly enriched in the upregulated anti-sense transcripts - in particular the EIF2 signaling pathway. These results call for a deeper exploration into anti-sense and noncoding RNA regulation in AMD and their potential as therapeutic targets.},

We profiled transcriptomes of ∼6,000 single cells from 18 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, including five matched pairs of primary tumors and lymph node metastases. Stromal and immune cells had consistent expression programs across patients. Conversely, malignant cells varied within and between tumors in their expression of signatures related to cell cycle, stress, hypoxia, epithelial differentiation, and partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (p-EMT). Cells expressing the p-EMT program spatially localized to the leading edge of primary tumors. By integrating single-cell transcriptomes with bulk expression profiles for hundreds of tumors, we refined HNSCC subtypes by their malignant and stromal composition and established p-EMT as an independent predictor of nodal metastasis, grade, and adverse pathologic features. Our results provide insight into the HNSCC ecosystem and define stromal interactions and a p-EMT program associated with metastasis. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma highlights the heterogeneous composition of malignant and non-malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment and associates a partial EMT program with metastasis.},

Currently, the GOC disseminates 126 million annotations covering {\textgreater}374,000 species including all the kingdoms of life. This number includes two classes of GO annotations: those created manually by experienced biocurators reviewing the literature or by examination of biological data (1.1 million annotations covering 2226 species) and those generated computationally via automated methods. As manual annotations are often used to propagate functional predictions between related proteins within and between genomes, it is critical to provide accurate consistent manual annotations. Toward this goal, we present here the conventions defined by the GOC for the creation of manual annotation. This guide represents the best practices for manual annotation as established by the GOC project over the past 12 years.

This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of data science for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in a massive open online course (MOOC). This new edition has been updated for Python 3, reorganized to make it easier to use for courses that cover only a subset of the material, and offers additional material including five new chapters. Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming.

abstract = {Knowledge of immune cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment is essential for understanding mechanisms of cancer progression and immunotherapy response. We profiled 45,000 immune cells from eight breast carcinomas, as well as matched normal breast tissue, blood, and lymph nodes, using single-cell RNA-seq. We developed a preprocessing pipeline, SEQC, and a Bayesian clustering and normalization method, Biscuit, to address computational challenges inherent to single-cell data. Despite significant similarity between normal and tumor tissue-resident immune cells, we observed continuous phenotypic expansions specific to the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data from 27,000 additional T cells revealed the combinatorial impact of TCR utilization on phenotypic diversity. Our results support a model of continuous activation in T cells and do not comport with the macrophage polarization model in cancer. Our results have important implications for characterizing tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Single-cell analysis of the breast tumor immune microenvironment, coupled with computational analysis, yields an immune map of breast cancer that points to continuous T cell activation and differentiation states.},

abstract = {Early age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterized by degeneration of the choriocapillaris, the vascular supply of retinal photoreceptor cells. We assessed vascular loss during disease progression in the choriocapillaris and larger vessels in the deeper choroid. Human donor maculae from controls (n = 99), early AMD (n = 35), or clinically diagnosed with geographic atrophy (GA; n = 9, collected from outside the zone of retinal pigment epithelium degeneration) were evaluated using Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I labeling to discriminate between vessels with intact endothelial cells and ghost vessels. Morphometric analyses of choriocapillaris density (cross-sectional area of capillary lumens divided by length) and of vascular lumen/stroma ratio in the outer choroid were performed. Choriocapillaris loss was observed in early AMD (Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.024) with greater loss in GA (Bonferroni-corrected P {\textless} 10−9), even in areas of intact retinal pigment epithelium. In contrast, changes in lumen/stroma ratio in the outer choroid were not found to differ between controls and AMD or GA eyes (P {\textgreater} 0.05), suggesting choriocapillaris changes are more prevalent in AMD than those in the outer choroid. In addition, vascular endothelial growth factor-A levels were negatively correlated with choriocapillaris vascular density. These findings support the concept that choroidal vascular degeneration, predominantly in the microvasculature, contributes to dry AMD progression. Addressing capillary loss in AMD remains an important translational target.},

abstract = {The cause of most hypertensive disease is unclear, but inflammation appears critical in disease progression. However, how elevated blood pressure initiates inflammation is unknown, as are the effects of high blood pressure on innate and adaptive immune responses. We now report that hypertensive mice have increased T cell responses to antigenic challenge and develop more severe T cell–mediated immunopathology. A root cause for this is hypertension-induced erythrocyte adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) release, leading to an increase in plasma ATP levels, which begins soon after the onset of hypertension and stimulates P2X7 receptors on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), increasing APC expression of CD86. Hydrolyzing ATP or blocking the P2X7 receptor eliminated hypertension-induced T cell hyperactivation. In addition, pharmacologic or genetic blockade of P2X7 receptor activity suppressed the progression of hypertension. Consistent with the results in mice, we also found that untreated human hypertensive patients have significantly elevated plasma ATP levels compared with treated hypertensive patients or normotensive controls. Thus, a hypertension-induced increase in extracellular ATP triggers augmented APC and T cell function and contributes to the immune-mediated pathologic changes associated with hypertensive disease.},

However, known and predicted interactions are scattered over multiple resources, and the available data exhibit notable differences in terms of quality and completeness. The STRING database (http://string-db.org) aims to provide a critical assessment and integration of protein-protein interactions, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) associations. The new version 10.0 of STRING covers more than 2000 organisms, which has necessitated novel, scalable algorithms for transferring interaction information between organisms. For this purpose, we have introduced hierarchical and self-consistent orthology annotations for all interacting proteins, grouping the proteins into families at various levels of phylogenetic resolution. Further improvements in version 10.0 include a completely redesigned prediction pipeline for inferring protein-protein associations from co-expression data, an API interface for the R computing environment and improved statistical analysis for enrichment tests in user-provided networks.},

@article{Wehrens2016,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION Batch effects in large untargeted metabolomics experiments are almost unavoidable, especially when sensitive detection techniques like mass spectrometry (MS) are employed. In order to obtain peak intensities that are comparable across all batches, corrections need to be performed. Since non-detects, i.e., signals with an intensity too low to be detected with certainty, are common in metabolomics studies, the batch correction methods need to take these into account. OBJECTIVES This paper aims to compare several batch correction methods, and investigates the effect of different strategies for handling non-detects. METHODS Batch correction methods usually consist of regression models, possibly also accounting for trends within batches. To fit these models quality control samples (QCs), injected at regular intervals, can be used. Also study samples can be used, provided that the injection order is properly randomized. Normalization methods, not using information on batch labels or injection order, can correct for batch effects as well. Introducing two easy-to-use quality criteria, we assess the merits of these batch correction strategies using three large LC-MS and GC-MS data sets of samples from Arabidopsis thaliana. RESULTS The three data sets have very different characteristics, leading to clearly distinct behaviour of the batch correction strategies studied. Explicit inclusion of information on batch and injection order in general leads to very good corrections; when enough QCs are available, also general normalization approaches perform well. Several approaches are shown to be able to handle non-detects-replacing them with very small numbers such as zero seems the worst of the approaches considered. CONCLUSION The use of quality control samples for batch correction leads to good results when enough QCs are available. If an experiment is properly set up, batch correction using the study samples usually leads to a similar high-quality correction, but has the advantage that more metabolites are corrected. The strategy for handling non-detects is important: choosing small values like zero can lead to suboptimal batch corrections.},

abstract = {A big challenge in proteomics is the identification of cell-type-specific proteomes in vivo. This protocol describes how to label, purify and identify cell-type-specific proteomes in living mice. To make this possible, we created a Cre-recombinase-inducible mouse line expressing a mutant methionyl-tRNA synthetase (L274G), which enables the labeling of nascent proteins with the non-canonical amino acid azidonorleucine (ANL). This amino acid can be conjugated to different affinity tags by click chemistry. After affinity purification (AP), the labeled proteins can be identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). With this method, it is possible to identify cell-type-specific proteomes derived from living animals, which was not possible with any previously published method. The reduction in sample complexity achieved by this protocol allows for the detection of subtle changes in cell-type-specific protein content in response to environmental changes. This protocol can be completed in {\~{}}10 d (plus the time needed to generate the mouse lines, the desired labeling period and MS analysis).},

We report here that erythro-myeloid progenitors in mice generate premacrophages (pMacs) that simultaneously colonize the whole embryo from embryonic day 9.5 in a chemokine-receptor-dependent manner. The core macrophage program initiated in pMacs is rapidly diversified as expression of transcriptional regulators becomes tissue-specific in early macrophages. This process appears essential for macrophage specification and maintenance, as inactivation of Id3 impairs the development of liver macrophages and results in selective Kupffer cell deficiency in adults. We propose that macrophage differentiation is an integral part of organogenesis, as colonization of organ anlagen by pMacs is followed by their specification into tissue macrophages, hereby generating the macrophage diversity observed in postnatal tissues.},

AMD is a multifactorial and only partly understood, malady. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for most AMD patients. It is known that oxidative stress (OS) damages the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and contributes to the progression of AMD. We review here the potential importance of two OS-related cellular systems in relation to AMD. First, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2; NRF2)-mediated OS response signalling pathway is important in the prevention of oxidative damage and a failure of this system could be critical in the development of AMD. Second, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) represents a change in the cellular phenotype, which ultimately leads to the fibrosis encountered in RPE, a characteristic of AMD. Many of the pathways triggering EMT are promoted by OS. The possible interconnections between these two signalling routes are discussed here. From a broader perspective, the control of NFE2L2 and EMT as ways of preventing OS-derived cellular damage could be potentially valuable in the therapy of AMD.},

abstract = {Low-grade, chronic inflammation has been associated with many diseases of aging, but the mechanisms responsible for producing this inflammation remain unclear. Inflammasomes can drive chronic inflammation in the context of an infectious disease or cellular stress, and they trigger the maturation of interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$). Here we find that the expression of specific inflammasome gene modules stratifies older individuals into two extremes: those with constitutive expression of IL-1$\beta$, nucleotide metabolism dysfunction, elevated oxidative stress, high rates of hypertension and arterial stiffness; and those without constitutive expression of IL-1$\beta$, who lack these characteristics. Adenine and N(4)-acetylcytidine, nucleotide-derived metabolites that are detectable in the blood of the former group, prime and activate the NLRC4 inflammasome, induce the production of IL-1$\beta$, activate platelets and neutrophils and elevate blood pressure in mice. In individuals over 85 years of age, the elevated expression of inflammasome gene modules was associated with all-cause mortality. Thus, targeting inflammasome components may ameliorate chronic inflammation and various other age-associated conditions.},

abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved sequence-specific gene regulatory mechanism(1-3) mediated by the RNA-induced silencing complex ( RISC), which is composed of a single-stranded guide RNA and an Argonaute protein. The PIWI domain, a highly conserved motif within Argonaute, has been shown to adopt an RNase H fold(4,5) critical for the endonuclease cleavage activity of RISC4-6. Here we report the crystal structure of Archaeoglobus fulgidus Piwi protein bound to double-stranded RNA, thereby identifying the binding pocket for guide-strand 5 '-end recognition and providing insight into guide-strand-mediated messenger RNA target recognition. The phosphorylated 5 ' end of the guide RNA is anchored within a highly conserved basic pocket, supplemented by the carboxy-terminal carboxylate and a bound divalent cation. The first nucleotide from the 5 ' end of the guide RNA is unpaired and stacks over a conserved tyrosine residue, whereas successive nucleotides form a four-base-pair RNA duplex. Mutation of the corresponding amino acids that contact the 5 ' phosphate in human Ago2 resulted in attenuated mRNA cleavage activity. Our structure of the Piwi-RNA complex, and that determined elsewhere(7), provide direct support for the 5 ' region of the guide RNA serving as a nucleation site for pairing with target mRNA and for a fixed distance separating the RISC-mediated mRNA cleavage site from the anchored 5 ' end of the guide RNA.},

Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a ‘molecular signature') to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of ‘omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous ‘omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple ‘omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures. We illustrate our latest mixOmics integrative frameworks for the multivariate analyses of ‘omics data available from the package.},

abstract = {Cell-to-cell variation is a universal feature of life that affects a wide range of biological phenomena, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity. Although recent advances have improved our ability to document cellular phenotypic variation, the fundamental mechanisms that generate variability from identical DNA sequences remain elusive. Here we reveal the landscape and principles of mammalian DNA regulatory variation by developing a robust method for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) integrated into a programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates chromosome compartments de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the 'regulome'.},

@article{Makarova2009a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In eukaryotes, RNA interference (RNAi) is a major mechanism of defense against viruses and transposable elements as well of regulating translation of endogenous mRNAs. The RNAi systems recognize the target RNA molecules via small guide RNAs that are completely or partially complementary to a region of the target. Key components of the RNAi systems are proteins of the Argonaute-PIWI family some of which function as slicers, the nucleases that cleave the target RNA that is base-paired to a guide RNA. Numerous prokaryotes possess the CRISPR-associated system (CASS) of defense against phages and plasmids that is, in part, mechanistically analogous but not homologous to eukaryotic RNAi systems. Many prokaryotes also encode homologs of Argonaute-PIWI proteins but their functions remain unknown. RESULTS: We present a detailed analysis of Argonaute-PIWI protein sequences and the genomic neighborhoods of the respective genes in prokaryotes. Whereas eukaryotic Ago/PIWI proteins always contain PAZ (oligonucleotide binding) and PIWI (active or inactivated nuclease) domains, the prokaryotic Argonaute homologs (pAgos) fall into two major groups in which the PAZ domain is either present or absent. The monophyly of each group is supported by a phylogenetic analysis of the conserved PIWI-domains. Almost all pAgos that lack a PAZ domain appear to be inactivated, and the respective genes are associated with a variety of predicted nucleases in putative operons. An additional, uncharacterized domain that is fused to various nucleases appears to be a unique signature of operons encoding the short (lacking PAZ) pAgo form. By contrast, almost all PAZ-domain containing pAgos are predicted to be active nucleases. Some proteins of this group (e.g., that from Aquifex aeolicus) have been experimentally shown to possess nuclease activity, and are not typically associated with genes for other (putative) nucleases. Given these observations, the apparent extensive horizontal transfer of pAgo genes, and their common, statistically significant over-representation in genomic neighborhoods enriched in genes encoding proteins involved in the defense against phages and/or plasmids, we hypothesize that pAgos are key components of a novel class of defense systems. The PAZ-domain containing pAgos are predicted to directly destroy virus or plasmid nucleic acids via their nuclease activity, whereas the apparently inactivated, PAZ-lacking pAgos could be structural subunits of protein complexes that contain, as active moieties, the putative nucleases that we predict to be co-expressed with these pAgos. All these nucleases are predicted to be DNA endonucleases, so it seems most probable that the putative novel phage/plasmid-defense system targets phage DNA rather than mRNAs. Given that in eukaryotic RNAi systems, the PAZ domain binds a guide RNA and positions it on the complementary region of the target, we further speculate that pAgos function on a similar principle (the guide being either DNA or RNA), and that the uncharacterized domain found in putative operons with the short forms of pAgos is a functional substitute for the PAZ domain. CONCLUSION: The hypothesis that pAgos are key components of a novel prokaryotic immune system that employs guide RNA or DNA molecules to degrade nucleic acids of invading mobile elements implies a functional analogy with the prokaryotic CASS and a direct evolutionary connection with eukaryotic RNAi. The predictions of the hypothesis including both the activities of pAgos and those of the associated endonucleases are readily amenable to experimental tests.},

Combining single-molecule fluorescence, molecular dynamic simulations, and structural studies, we show that TtAgo loads dsDNA molecules with a preference toward a deoxyguanosine on the passenger strand at the position opposite to the 5??? end of the guide strand. This explains why in??vivo TtAgo is preferentially loaded with guides with a 5??? end deoxycytidine.

abstract = {Eukaryotic Argonaute proteins induce gene silencing by small RNA-guided recognition and cleavage of mRNA targets. Although structural similarities between human and prokaryotic Argonautes are consistent with shared mechanistic properties, sequence and structure-based alignments suggested that Argonautes encoded within CRISPR-cas[clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated] bacterial immunity operons have divergent activities. We show here that the CRISPR-associatedMarinitoga piezophilaArgonaute (MpAgo) protein cleaves single-stranded target sequences using 5'-hydroxylated guide RNAs rather than the 5'-phosphorylated guides used by all known Argonautes. The 2.0-{\AA} resolution crystal structure of an MpAgo-RNA complex reveals a guide strand binding site comprising residues that block 5' phosphate interactions. Using structure-based sequence alignment, we were able to identify other putative MpAgo-like proteins, all of which are encoded within CRISPR-casloci. Taken together, our data suggest the evolution of an Argonaute subclass with noncanonical specificity for a 5'-hydroxylated guide.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved. Argonaute (Ago) proteins in eukaryotes are known as key players in post-transcriptional gene silencing 1, while recent studies on prokaryotic Agos hint at their role in the protection against invading DNA 2,3. Here, we present crystal structures of the apo enzyme and a binary Ago-guide complex of the archaeal Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Mj) Ago. Binding of a guide DNA leads to large structural rearrangements. This includes the structural transformation of a hinge region contai ning a switch helix, which has been shown for human Ago2 to be critical for the dynamic target search process 4-6. To identify key residues crucial for MjAgo function, we analysed the effect of several MjAgo mutants. We observe that the nature of the 3′ and 5′ nucleotides in particular, as well as the switch helix, appear to impact MjAgo cleavage activity. In summary, we provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that drive DNA-guided DNA silencing by an archaeal Ago.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier is a dynamic interface that separates the brain from the circulatory system, and it is formed by highly specialized endothelial cells. To explore the molecular mechanisms defining the unique nature of vascular development and differentiation in the brain, we generated high-resolution gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic brain endothelial cells using translating ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing. We compared the brain vascular translatome with the vascular translatomes of other organs and analyzed the vascular translatomes of the brain at different time points during embryonic development. Because canonical Wnt signaling is implicated in the formation of the blood-brain barrier, we also compared the brain endothelial translatome of wild-type mice with that of mice lacking the transcriptional cofactor $\beta$-catenin (Ctnnb1). Our analysis revealed extensive molecular changes during the embryonic development of the brain endothelium. We identified genes encoding brain endothelium-specific transcription factors (Foxf2, Foxl2, Foxq1, Lef1, Ppard, Zfp551, and Zic3) that are associated with maturation of the blood-brain barrier and act downstream of the Wnt-b-catenin signaling pathway. Profiling of individual brain endothelial cells revealed substantial heterogeneity in the population. Nevertheless, the high abundance of Foxf2, Foxq1, Ppard, or Zic3 transcripts correlated with the increased expression of genes encoding markers of brain endothelial cell differentiation. Expression of Foxf2 and Zic3 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced the production of blood-brain barrier differentiation markers. This comprehensive data set may help to improve the engineering of in vitro blood-brain barrier models.},

abstract = {Computational single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methods have been successfully applied to experiments representing a single condition, technology, or species to discover and define cellular phenotypes. However, identifying subpopulations of cells that are present across multiple data sets remains challenging. Here, we introduce an analytical strategy for integrating scRNA-seq data sets based on common sources of variation, enabling the identification of shared populations across data sets and downstream comparative analysis. We apply this approach, implemented in our R toolkit Seurat (http://satijalab. org/seurat/), to align scRNA-seq data sets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced using two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell 'atlases' generated from human and mouse islets. In each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across data sets, while boosting statistical power through integrated analysis. Our approach facilitates general comparisons of scRNA-seq data sets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution. With recent improvements in cost and throughput 1–3 , and the avail-ability of fully commercialized workflows 4 , high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics has become an accessible and powerful tool for unbi-ased profiling of complex and heterogeneous systems. In concert with novel computational approaches, these data sets can be used for the discovery of cell types and states 5,6 , the reconstruction of developmen-tal trajectories and fate decisions 7,8 , and to spatially model complex tis-sues 9,10 . Indeed, scRNA-seq is poised to transform our understanding of developmental biology and gene regulation 11–14 , and enable system-atic reconstruction of cellular taxonomies across the human body 6,15 , although substantial computational obstacles remain. In particular, integrated analysis of different scRNA-seq data sets, consisting of mul-tiple transcriptomic subpopulations, either to compare heterogeneous tissues across different conditions or to integrate measurements pro-duced by different technologies, remains challenging. Many powerful methods address individual components of this problem. For example, zero-inflated differential expression tests have been tailored to scRNA-seq data to identify changes within a single-cell type 16,17 , and clustering approaches 18–23 can detect proportional shifts across conditions if cell types are conserved. However, comparative analysis for scRNA-seq poses a unique challenge, as it is difficult to distinguish between changes in the proportional composition of cell types in a sample and expression changes within a given cell type, and simultaneous analysis of multiple data sets will confound these two disparate effects. Therefore, new methods are needed that can jointly analyze multiple data sets and facilitate comparative analysis down-stream. Progress toward this goal is essential for translating the oncom-ing wealth of single-cell sequencing data into biological insight. An integrated computational framework for joint learning between data sets would allow for robust and insightful comparisons of heterogene-ous tissues in health and disease, integration of data from diverse tech-nologies, and comparison of single-cell data from different species. Here, we present a novel computational strategy for integrated analysis of scRNA-seq data sets, motivated by techniques in com-puter vision designed for the alignment and integration of imaging data sets 24,25 . We demonstrate that multivariate methods designed for 'manifold alignment' 26,27 can be successfully applied to scRNA-seq data to identify gene–gene correlation patterns that are conserved across data sets and can embed cells in a shared low-dimensional space. We identify and compare 13 aligned peripheral blood mono-nuclear cell (PBMC) subpopulations under resting and interferon $\beta$ (IFN-$\beta$)-stimulated conditions, align scRNA-seq data sets of com-plex tissues produced across multiple technologies, and jointly dis-cover shared cell types from droplet-based 'atlases' of human and mouse pancreatic tissue. These analyses pose distinct challenges for alignment, but in each case, we successfully integrate the data sets to obtain deeper biological insight than would be possible from inde-pendent analysis. Our approach can be applied to data sets ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of cells, is compatible with diverse profiling technologies, and is implemented as part of Seurat, an open-source R toolkit for single-cell genomics.},

We report that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in combination with massively parallel oligomer synthesis can enable trackable editing on a genome-wide scale.

We provide preliminary evidence that CREATE will work in yeast. We also provide a webtool to design multiplex CREATE libraries.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION The field of metabolomics has expanded greatly over the past two decades, both as an experimental science with applications in many areas, as well as in regards to data standards and bioinformatics software tools. The diversity of experimental designs and instrumental technologies used for metabolomics has led to the need for distinct data analysis methods and the development of many software tools. OBJECTIVES To compile a comprehensive list of the most widely used freely available software and tools that are used primarily in metabolomics. METHODS The most widely used tools were selected for inclusion in the review by either ≥ 50 citations on Web of Science (as of 08/09/16) or the use of the tool being reported in the recent Metabolomics Society survey. Tools were then categorised by the type of instrumental data (i.e. LC-MS, GC-MS or NMR) and the functionality (i.e. pre- and post-processing, statistical analysis, workflow and other functions) they are designed for. RESULTS A comprehensive list of the most used tools was compiled. Each tool is discussed within the context of its application domain and in relation to comparable tools of the same domain. An extended list including additional tools is available at https://github.com/RASpicer/MetabolomicsTools which is classified and searchable via a simple controlled vocabulary. CONCLUSION This review presents the most widely used tools for metabolomics analysis, categorised based on their main functionality. As future work, we suggest a direct comparison of tools' abilities to perform specific data analysis tasks e.g. peak picking.},

abstract = {Metabolomics has emerged as a powerful tool for addressing biological questions. Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is widely used for metabolic characterization, including targeted and untargeted approaches. Despite recent innovations, a crucial aspect of this technique is the sample preparation for accurate data analyses. In this protocol, we present a robust and adaptable workflow for metabolic analyses of mammalian cells from adherent cell cultures, which is particularly suited for qualitative and quantitative central metabolite characterization by LC-MS. Each sample consists of 6,000,000 mammalian cells grown on cover glasses, allowing for fast and complete transfer of the cells for metabolite extraction or medium exchange, e.g., for labeling experiments. The sampling procedure includes a fast and efficient washing step in liquid flow in water, which reduces cross-contamination and matrix effects while minimizing perturbation of the metabolic steady state of the cells; it is followed by quenching cell metabolism. The latter is achieved by using a -20 °C cold methanol acetonitrile mixture acidified with formic acid, followed by freeze drying, metabolite extraction and LC-MS. The protocol requires 2 s for cell sampling until quenching, and the entire protocol takes a total of 1.5 h per sample when the provided nanoscale LC-MS method is applied.},

Moreover, for the genes detected by microarray and SOLiD sequencing, our assay detected new transcript variants for a large proportion of them, which confirms unambiguously at single-cell resolution that the transcriptome complexity is higher than expected traditionally.

The most highly conserved position in that motif is the purine in position -3 (three nucleotides upstream from the ATG codon); 97{\%} of vertebrate mRNAs have a purine, most often A, in that position. The periodi- cal occurrence of G (in positions -3, -6, -9) is discussed. Upstream ATG codons occur in fewer than 10{\%} of vertebrate mRNAs-at-large; a notable exception are oncogene transcripts, two-thirds of which have ATG codons preceding the start of the major open reading frame. The leader sequences of most vertebrate mRNAs fall in the size range of 20 tolOOnucleotides. The significance of shorter and longer 5'-noncoding sequences is discussed.},

Within a short timeframe, the cells of the three germ layers transform into an embryo that includes most of the major internal and external organs. Here we investigate the transcriptional dynamics of mouse organogenesis at single-cell resolution. Using single-cell combinatorial indexing, we profiled the transcriptomes of around 2 million cells derived from 61 embryos staged between 9.5 and 13.5 days of gestation, in a single experiment. The resulting ‘mouse organogenesis cell atlas' (MOCA) provides a global view of developmental processes during this critical window. We use Monocle 3 to identify hundreds of cell types and 56 trajectories, many of which are detected only because of the depth of cellular coverage, and collectively define thousands of corresponding marker genes. We explore the dynamics of gene expression within cell types and trajectories over time, including focused analyses of the apical ectodermal ridge, limb mesenchyme and skeletal muscle.},

abstract = {Purpose: To assess and compare choroidal thickness changes related to aging, we determined whether changes are due to thinning of the choriocapillaris plus Sattler's (CS) layer and/or the large vessel layer in healthy eyes using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) at a wavelength of 1,050-nm. Methods: We studied 115 normal eyes of 115 healthy volunteers, all with refractive errors of less than -6 diopters. All 115 eyes underwent analysis of choroidal thickness at the fovea, the CS layer and the large choroidal vessel layer. In 68 of the 115 eyes, choroidal thickness was determined at five sites (the fovea, and superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal sites) using SS-OCT with an Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy grid scan. Results: Total choroidal thicknesses at each of the five sites were related to subject age (P{\textless}0.0001). The choroid was thinnest at the nasal site, followed by the temporal, inferior, superior and finally the subfoveal site itself. The total choroidal thickness at the nasal site was significantly less than those at the other four sites (p{\textless}0.05). The CS layer showed thinning which correlated with age (P{\textless}0.0001). The thickness of the choroidal large vessel layer also decreased with age (p = 0.02). Subfoveal choroidal thickness was calculated as follows: 443.89-2.98xage ($\mu$m) (P{\textless}0.0001). Conclusion: Subfoveal choroidal thickness decreases by 2.98 $\mu$m each year. Total choroidal thickness diminishes with age. The CS and large vessel layers of the choroid at the subfovea showed significant decreases, though only the former correlated strongly with age.},

abstract = {Despite the great importance of membrane proteins, structural and functional studies of these proteins present major challenges. A significant hurdle is the extraction of the functional protein from its natural lipid membrane. Traditionally achieved with detergents, purification procedures can be costly and time consuming. A critical flaw with detergent approaches is the removal of the protein from the native lipid environment required to maintain functionally stable protein. This protocol describes the preparation of styrene maleic acid (SMA) co-polymer to extract membrane proteins from prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems. Successful isolation of membrane proteins into SMA lipid particles (SMALPs) allows the proteins to remain with native lipid, surrounded by SMA. We detail procedures for obtaining 25 g of SMA (4 d); explain the preparation of protein-containing SMALPs using membranes isolated from Escherichia coli (2 d) and control protein-free SMALPS using E. coli polar lipid extract (1-2 h); investigate SMALP protein purity by SDS-PAGE analysis and estimate protein concentration (4 h); and detail biophysical methods such as circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (svAUC) to undertake initial structural studies to characterize SMALPs (∼ 2 d). Together, these methods provide a practical tool kit for those wanting to use SMALPs to study membrane proteins.},

abstract = {We have examined the discrete species of simian virus 40 (SV40) RNA present very early in infection of monkey cells with wild-type virus, with mutant tsA58 virus, and with the corresponding DNAs to distinguish between two classes of models for control of late transcription: (i) positive control mediated by large-T antigen and (ii) negative control mediated by a repressor protein associated with viral DNA in the virion. Total cytoplasmic or nuclear polyadenylated RNAs from infected cells were denatured with glyoxal, separated by electrophoresis on agarose gels, and transferred to diazobenzyloxymethyl paper. The positions of specific early and late RNA species were determined with region-specific SV40 DNA probes. The technique can detect individual RNAs present at the level of less than one copy per cell. After 9.5 h at 37 degrees C, appreciable amounts of two early RNAs (2.6 kilobases [kb] and 2.9 kb) were present in the cytoplasm of cells infected with wild-type virus or DNA, along with much smaller amounts of two late RNAs, 1.6 kb (16S) and 2.5 kb (19S). The amounts of the late RNAs were reduced, but they were still synthesized in the presence of cytosine arabinoside, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis. In comparable infections with tsA58 virus or DNA at nonpermissive temperature (41 degrees C), substantial amounts of the two early RNAs were again present, but the two late RNAs could not be detected. However, small amounts of the late RNAs were found when infections with tsA58 virus or DNA were prolonged to 30 h at 41 degrees C. These results are not consistent with negative control of late transcription through the action of a repressor and, taken together with other data, suggest that T antigen has an active role in late RNA synthesis. Specific early and late viral RNAs were also detected in the nuclear poly(A)(+) fractions and were similar in size to the RNA species found in the cytoplasmic polyadenylated fractions. The late nuclear RNAs (1.8 and 2.9 kb) were significantly larger than the late cytoplasmic species, possibly because they are precursors. The 2.6- and 2.9-kb early RNAs found in the cytoplasm are probably the messengers for large-T and small-t antigens, respectively.},

Membrane proteins are the most valuable group of proteins since they are the target for 70–80{\%} of all drugs. Perbio Science has developed a protocol for the quick, easy, and reproducible isolation of integral membrane proteins from eukaryotic cells. This procedure utilizes a proprietary formulation to facilitate cell membrane disruption in a mild, nondenaturing environment and efficiently solubilizes membrane proteins. The technique utilizes a two-phase partitioning system that enables the class separation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic proteins. A variety of protein markers were used to investigate the partitioning efficiency of the membrane protein extraction reagents (Mem-PER) (Mem-PER is a registered trademark of Pierce Biotechnology, Inc) system. These included membrane proteins with one or more transmembrane spanning domains as well as peripheral and cytosolic proteins. Based on densitometry analyses of our Western blots, we obtained excellent solubilization of membrane proteins with less than 10{\%} contamination of the hydrophobic fraction with hydrophilic proteins. Compared to other methodologies for membrane protein solubilization that use time-consuming protocols or expensive and cumbersome instrumentation, the Mem-PER reagents system for eukaryotic membrane protein extraction offers an easy, efficient, and reproducible method to isolate membrane proteins from mammalian and yeast cells.},

First described in 2007, the HMDB is now considered the standard metabolomic resource for human metabolic studies. Over the past decade the HMDB has continued to grow and evolve in response to emerging needs for metabolomics researchers and continuing changes in web standards. This year's update, HMDB 4.0, represents the most significant upgrade to the database in its history. For instance, the number of fully annotated metabolites has increased by nearly threefold, the number of experimental spectra has grown by almost fourfold and the number of illustrated metabolic pathways has grown by a factor of almost 60. Significant improvements have also been made to the HMDB's chemical taxonomy, chemical ontology, spectral viewing, and spectral/text searching tools. A great deal of brand new data has also been added to HMDB 4.0. This includes large quantities of predicted MS/MS and GC-MS reference spectral data as well as predicted (physiologically feasible) metabolite structures to facilitate novel metabolite identification. Additional information on metabolite-SNP interactions and the influence of drugs on metabolite levels (pharmacometabolomics) has also been added. Many other important improvements in the content, the interface, and the performance of the HMDB website have been made and these should greatly enhance its ease of use and its potential applications in nutrition, biochemistry, clinical chemistry, clinical genetics, medicine, and metabolomics science.},

abstract = {Gene expression profiling by high-throughput sequencing reveals qualitative and quantitative changes in RNA species at steady state but obscures the intracellular dynamics of RNA transcription, processing and decay. We developed thiol(SH)-linked alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA (SLAM seq), an orthogonal-chemistry-based RNA sequencing technology that detects 4-thiouridine (s4U) incorporation in RNA species at single-nucleotide resolution. In combination with well-established metabolic RNA labeling protocols and coupled to standard, low-input, high-throughput RNA sequencing methods, SLAM seq enabled rapid access to RNA-polymerase-II-dependent gene expression dynamics in the context of total RNA. We validated the method in mouse embryonic stem cells by showing that the RNA-polymerase-II-dependent transcriptional output scaled with Oct4/Sox2/Nanog-defined enhancer activity, and we provide quantitative and mechanistic evidence for transcript-specific RNA turnover mediated by post-transcriptional gene regulatory pathways initiated by microRNAs and N6-methyladenosine. SLAM seq facilitates the dissection of fundamental mechanisms that control gene expression in an accessible, cost-effective and scalable manner.},

In this work, we have developed a method to photocage the activity of the guide RNA called "CRISPR-plus" (CRISPR-precise light-mediated unveiling of sgRNAs). The photoactivation capability of our CRISPR-plus method is compatible with the simultaneous targeting of multiple DNA sequences and supports numerous modifications that can enable guide RNA labeling for use in imaging and mechanistic investigations.},

@article{Gonzales2009,
abstract = {Acid-sensing ion channels are proton-activated, sodium-selective channels composed of three subunits, and are members of the superfamily of epithelial sodium channels, mechanosensitive and FMRF-amide peptide-gated ion channels. These ubiquitous eukaryotic ion channels have essential roles in biological activities as diverse as sodium homeostasis, taste and pain. Despite their crucial roles in biology and their unusual trimeric subunit stoichiometry, there is little knowledge of the structural and chemical principles underlying their ion channel architecture and ion-binding sites. Here we present the structure of a functional acid-sensing ion channel in a desensitized state at 3 A resolution, the location and composition of the approximately 8 A 'thick' desensitization gate, and the trigonal antiprism coordination of caesium ions bound in the extracellular vestibule. Comparison of the acid-sensing ion channel structure with the ATP-gated P2X(4) receptor reveals similarity in pore architecture and aqueous vestibules, suggesting that there are unanticipated yet common structural and mechanistic principles.},
