```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

A standard R plot can be made interactive by wrapping it in the Shiny `renderPlot()` function. The `selectInput()` function creates the input widget to drive the plot.  

```{r eruption, echo = F}
selectInput('breaks', label = "Number of bins:", 
            choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50),
            selected = 20)

renderPlot({
    par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 0.5))
    
    hist(faithful$eruptions, as.numeric(input$breaks),
     col = "gray", border = "white", xlab = "Duration (minutes)",
     main = "",
     ylim = c(0, 45))
})
```
